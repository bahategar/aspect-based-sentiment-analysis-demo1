        "review": "I don't know why people get the idea that hospital bills in the US are insane here inside this comment section. My mother uses Medicare and is absolutely fine (it is there for people who apply for it but people don't apply for it). I have insurance as well, which would have been paid by taxes anyways that I'd have to put into if we had your style of system. Are there issues with the healthcare system? Yes. Is Europe absolutely perfect with its healthcare, despite how much funding goes into it? No. It has many flaws. \r\n\r\nThese black and white blanket statements are rather silly. Every country has their pros and cons. Europeans don't understand that the US itself is ALMOST as large as all of Europe combined. Imagine driving from the top most point of Europe to the southern most point and see how long that would take you. We have far larger surface area to get to places and different issues because of it. One country has to deal with a very tiny amount of road space compared to the US. We have much larger roads so it can accommodate trucking because it is how we can best get inventory all across of the nation (think of trying to do that for all of Europe with our size comparison). \r\n\r\nWe also have a different culture and different interests. We have many, many different cultures within the US. You go one state over and you'll find a ton of differences in way of thinking and doing things. It would be better to compare the US by states like you do European countries because that is what it would be like for size comparison. You should compare healthcare by state to other EU countries healthcare. And not every EU healthcare is that great, let's be honest. And Europe has almost 2.5x the population as the United States with a lot more infrastructure built over thousands of years. How can you compare that to a country as young as the US. Let's be honest here.\r\n\r\nCrime rate? \r\n\r\nLuxembourg has a murder rate of 1.39 per 100,000 people.\r\nLatvia has a 4.05%.\r\nFinland has a 1.5%.\r\nTurkey has a 2.46%.\r\nEstonia has a 1.35%.\r\nLithuania is 2.21%.\r\n\r\nWhat about the US?\r\n\r\nMaine's murder rate is 1.03% WHAT?! No way! Lower than EU ?!\r\nNew Hampshire is 1.26%\r\nConnecticut is 1.5%\r\nMississippi is 2.45%\r\nKentucky is 2.14%\r\n\r\nIs the US generally less safe than Europe? Yes. We also have many things and rights that EU doesn't have or apparently want, which is fine. People will vote and choose to live how they want. If the US wants what they have then what right do you have to try and tell them otherwise. EU is far from perfect. Just as the US is far from perfect. Work on your own country and stop attacking others. Maybe you'll make your home a better place to live rather than typing random stuff on a video you probably should never have watched to begin with since it doesn't sell to you.\r\n\r\nI find many of these arguments very pointless. Countries are different and do things differently. Why you won't conform to the way the US does things the US won't conform to the way you do things. Just live your life in your culture and if you don't like the car, then don't buy it. I don't know why you'd be on this video if it isn't something you're invested in getting. It just feels like hate mobbing, throwing hatred at something you, as you say, never see where you're from. Why can't people just enjoy things that they enjoy? If people like the big truck and a place allows it and the voters are fine with it in that country, then let it be.",

I figured I was somewhere between 150k-200k based on some articles I read at the time. The recent recalls where they are forced to publish figures suggest Tesla made some 12K trucks by July 2024. So, how did I get invited unless like 80-90% dropped out?!\n2. I am looking on CarGurus now and the Cyberbeast, which is like 131k for the tag, is being sold in multiple states for 140k-143k which is a modest premium and is almost breakeven\n\nDoes this sound like what was advertised? I think I have another 2-3 months before they call me for the final payment and delivery but this is starting to look like a major flop and I might have to walk away since cheaper to let go of the deposits than pick up a car which could be depreciating like the rest of the Teslas. Where can I see reliable information on how many cars they made and how many preorders still exist?\n\nAlso, was considering renting it on Turo for like $350-400/day. Thoughts on the feasibility?",

Too many reviews where you fall over yourself to manufacture an enthusiasm about something that is obviously very flawed, to the point of glossing over and sometimes outright ignoring a lot of glaring issues. From the beginning I already couldn't take this video seriously, the montage of people taking pictures just made me roll my eyes so hard, especially with the hindsight that most of those folks were almost certainly taking pictures to make fun of it to their friends later. And to call that the \"most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck\" while speeding past it's more minor, well-known issues and then not addressing any of the other more serious problems that make this hunk of junk as unsafe as it is. This review has already aged very poorly in just a few months, but that into is gonna mean less than nothing in like four months when the novelty of seeing one in the wild has worn off and the general public has gotten bored or tired of seeing it. Hell, if anything the more real \"danger\" is that I'd be willing to bet a significant amount of drivers will be nastier to and more inclined to drive aggressively around a Cybertruck than other vehicles. \n\nI just kinda feel like if you're not gonna take a product review seriously and be honest and real about it, why do the review at all?\n\nHaven't seen the video you did about it for your car review channel, hoping that one is better but I'm not holding my breath.

Tonneau cover seals getting jammed up?  Windshield wiper motors burning out?).

The tires were damaged from the wheel covers, the dash panel was warped for some reason, and the bedcover was crooked. Also, I found out from the owner that this thing is so dangerous it can\u2019t pass European safety standards. The leeway given in these reviews by Marques, saying future builds will fix all of these issues, is mind blowing to me. Especially, given the inconsistency in his criticism compared to other product reviews\u2026 Tearing other products apart for not launching in the condition for which they were promised by the company before launch, but in this video he just makes excuses again and again for all of the glaring problems and missing features when it comes to this literally poorly made steel death machine. It\u2019s kind of astounding. Personally, I did find the drive by wire steering to be the best thing about the cybertruck after driving it. But they could have put that technology in anything else that wasn\u2019t just poorly designed and poorly manufactured in so many other respects. I honestly question Marques\u2019 ethical principles as a reviewer after watching these cybertruck reviews in comparison to his other reviews. Just disappointing.",

You start to talk about towing -but shift to talk about how most people don't tow. You start to talk about off-road performance, but shift to talk about most people not going off-road. What is the actual towing or off-road capability of the Cybertruck? You didn't say, but instead essentially invalidated the question, telling us we don't care. You say it steers well, which is an actual car review thing, but never talk about the size of the bed of the truck, or the comfort of the backseats. As has been mentioned the most iconic car design has always been the Volkswagen Beetle - affordable and everywhere for decades.  The Cybertruck may be iconic in the way the PT Cruiser is iconic - a full-sized toy of limited use for people desperate to impress people they pass on the street but don't know.",

Cars are made to crumple so that the kinetic energy, the force of the crash goes through the car itself instead of your body. Whiplash at best and seriously injured at worst from a simple crash. \n2 You did not mention the \"Car wash mode\" at all. They did not make the seals to the power points well enough to keep water out so they made that mode to close those parts and protect the car. But if you have adhd like me or just having a stressful/busy day, you will forget and brick your 'truck'. Not to mention I've seen posts about this happening and it will void the warranty so you're screwed. \n3 You did mention that the windows are stronger than normal but, specifically they are meant to be shatterproof. Sure this is great if you live in a high crime area but, what would happen if you went off a bridge? I can't say ive seen one submerged so i don't know exactly how it would go, but normal procedure is, unbuckle, grab something for breaking the window and bust out the back windshield. How are you going to do that with this? \n4 You didn't mention a common problem with Tesla cars in general, that the doors are completely powered by the battery. ( Some may be different, i don't know ) And there are many reports of their battery dying for one reason or not, and becoming unable to get in or out of the car. If this 'truck' were to have this problem, how would you get out/back in? You can't get out the windows thats for sure, and tow companys are going to have a hell of a time getting it to a shop of its stuck in park.\nI can understand if maybe you didn't want to include these because they specifically weren't your experience, but they should atleast have a footnote in the video instead of completely ignored. (These issues are just from a couple other videos I've seen and im sure there will be more.)",

Everything that is extraordinary (whether new, old, rare or custom) attracts attention. \"'Towing', 'transporting' and 'off-roading' (...)\" - This is a sobering assessment of how useful a car like this really is, which will probably only be used as a means of transport by the millions of pre-orderers. \"And that's ok.\" Why criticise when there's actually nothing to criticise? A big truck with a trailer is also not suitable for picking up your child from school or driving to the supermarket to do the shopping, but it's OK! Of course 'freedom' is ok and the fascination of possibilities, but if you also consider other 'iconic' features as a selling point (shockproof, bulletproof), do US-Americans have to survive everywhere like in 'Escape from New York'?! Also no crumple zone - so me first even if I'm at fault in an accident, even then - that can really hurt.\nDon't get me wrong, I think it's cool and I'd love to drive and own one, but it's just nonsensical.

        "review_processed": "I'm having trouble deciding if it's more or less responsible to review the Cybertruck with or without discussing Elon Musk's problematic socio-political issues. The reason I would give a thumbs down to a Cyber truck isn't that it's not interesting or even good looking, but that I can't support a man like Elon Musk."

The interior is in a very low quality style, the steal gets dirty and rusty very easily and buyers have a lot of restrictions with how to clean it and how often. There are examples, that already show problems with the steal after 11 days. Furthermore i would have liked if you could have showed the dangers of the car (sensors of trunk dont work, means that if fingers are in they are off; the edges at the doors are very sharp; if you run over someone they are most likely dead). Still good video, thanks for the content.\u2764",

Its a SUV in a shape of a truck (because its bad at everything that a truck should do), it has shoddy build quality (just look at the discolered doors - that can't be intentional), almost all controls are on the touch screen making it very distracing for the driver to use. And thats all aside from the design, which is controverial and I peronally don't like it, but I can see how somebody else can like it, even if its just for the novelty.\nSo I all you want is essentially a SUV with a extravagant design and care more about how you are seen on the road than what the car actually does for you, its the car for you.",

The stainless steel panels rust very easily (anything from dead bugs to bird droppings can lead to rusting) and the panels will start to change colour if exposed to water whilst in the sun (something like the second CT at 26:01).\n2. To avoid the rusting problem Tesla charges 5k to put a protective coating on the panels which they should have put on it in the first place\n3. The panels are not fucking bulletproof\n4. Drag racing it is pretty dumb if you are not going to be towing stuff either. One could argue that the people who buy the CT are more likely to tow something than ever be in any form of race with it.\n5. For a truck it has a very tiny bay, no bigger than the average Suzuki light truck, this is a very important bit of information considering how that bay size dictates how much you can potentially carry. You didn't at all dwell on this part and only briefly touched on it by saying you and your crew use it to move your equipment but exactly how much equipment was that bro? Surely you caould have taken 2 or 3 minutes to just show how many grocery bags or suitcases can fit in the bay and taken 2 or 3 less minutes glazing the \"iconic design\" \n6. For health and safety reasons it is entirely irresponsible to not accurately communicate how much of a bruising and cutting hazard the sharp steel edges of the doors actually are, I have seen videos of carrots getting sliced and chopped against the edges of the door, they're like fucking katanas \ud83d\ude02.\nAnyway, I hope in a year or so we can get a more well rounded review from you tackling the issues I've just highlighted, especially number 6 because if anyone who owns a toddler has designs on buying this dumb truck, they should at least know that it comes with the possibility of leaving their toddler devoid of a finger or two.",

I would think second hand owner market is much more sensible and chooses based on those qualities not some temporal celebrity fad. This car will age terribly, and maintenance will be very costly.

It's like a 2006 Honda Ridgeline drawn by a 4 year old made by a company whose grifter CEO acts like a 5 year old. Tesla was already the epitome of 'Form over Function' due to prioritizing aesthetics and high profit margins (for example, by removing radar and ultrasonic sensors for cheaper optical cameras), but this model takes that to a new low by having a hideous form. I've seen several in person (both standard and ones with wraps), and they're hideous and ridiculous. The production quality is predictably horrible (the production issues as addressed in the video are inexcusable for such a tiny run of *luxury* vehicles), repairs are absurdly expensive, and the brake lights don't work properly. The actual utility of it (as mentioned in the video) is laughable because it has low towing power,  you can't fit much in the truck bed, it has difficulty going up inclines that over vehicles climb with ease, the range is significantly less than advertised, the battery compartment is only half full, and it needs to be cleaned off shortly after getting wet. Tesla even says you shouldn't take it through a car wash! It's not bulletproof except against a small percentage of handguns, and the height and design of the vehicle makes it difficult to see pedestrians in front of you. Yoke steering wheels are also a known safety hazard. But hey, you do you I guess.\n\nAnother fun fact is that working at Tesla is dangerous because the company is infamous for ignoring safety best practices in their factories because Musk hates the color yellow, doesn't like safety signs, and doesn't like beeping noises. Not sure why he even cares what the factories look like, since he's not an engineer, he apparently doesn't care about the condition Tesla vehicles leave the factories in, and he's on Twitter all the time anyway.",

        "review": "In the current age of mass information - nothing material can be iconic. There is nothing that is unbelievable or not seen before. The social networks made the sharing of ideas available for absolutely every person in the world. The inventions became just trends, the misteries became debunked in the comments, the heroes became influencers in order to monetize their status. And that is fine - just this is the product of the reality, that we live in. If there was Instagram during the Trojan War, Achilles would be a viral star and he will leave Hector alive, so can make a podcast with him later on youtube. Last week I was exploring Milano. During one of the evenings I was waiting the metro to arrive and there were multiple screens on the walls of the station. They were showing the Pope reading statesments about the situation in Israel. And on the bottom there was a banner with a brief information. On the left it was written \"PAPA\", which is Pope in italian. But not \"the Pope\" (Il Papa), not Pope Francis, but just \"PAPA\". There were around 50 people around. May be I was the only one who was watching the broadcast with the Pope. Nobody was interested at all and this is in Italy. Can you imagine in 15 or 16th Century, what it would be to see and listen to the pope. One of a kind experience in your life, almost like a devine moment. Now some influencers who give money if you are the last one leaving a red circle on the ground, are more important for the people than the pope. But here is the difference. Nobody is interested in Mr Beast as a human, or even as a YouTube genius. 99% are interested in his money and his exposure. You need him either to earn easy money, or to receive gigantic advertising, hence again earn a lot of money. When the legend has a price it turns to a bestseller. Mr Beast is not and he will never be an icon. The CyberTruck is not and it will never be an icon. Not in the Today's world. It is impossible. The money are the God of Internet and \"in GOD we TRUST\" (TRUST not Believe). The Saint halo is a \"Verified\" badge. That is what you need to see in order to be sure that this is the real \"devine\" person. There is this show on NG \"The best of the decades\"... and they show the icons of each DECADE. Icon for a decade? Some of the saints are icons for 2000 years.  This is what happens when you bind the virtues with money. The future of the human kind doesn't rely on how popular we are, it relies on how sustainable we are as a society. The real science knowledge, the real art and the real life virtues brought us to the 21st Century. Only if you are considered a true genius in those 3 life aspects, you can become a true icon. The Cybertruck will be just a cool truck with a cool story in 10 years, but Elon Musk will be considered as a genius even after 100 years. Elon is the Icon, not the Cybertruck. Nobody remembers who was a millionaire in Salzburg in the times of Mozart, but Mozart is still considered one of the greatest geniuses of the Music for all times. Nobody speaks about the wealthy nobles who ordered Da Vinci to paint for them. But Da Vinci is still considered as a science and an art genius for almost 500 years already. And that is their purpose - to give the human kind a good future, or we will extinct. The human kind exists for around a million years, and our modern world and society exists only for two Centuries. We are frighteningly close to reverse the process. The idea to make the people good hearted and educated, the society to be sustainable, is what keeps the ICONS alive. Everything other lives shortly and will be forgotten.",

These could be customized to be heavy equipment tools like dozers, excavators, cranes etc on the moon.

Ironically I would bet that it will eventually end up in a Chinese metal and electronics recycling facility. Industrial dishwashers are made from higher grade stainless steel than the body of that truck. Anyone with knowledge of metal compositions can tell you that stainless steel has several grades and anything other than 316 grade stainless steel which is the highest grade, 316 grade stainless steel is actually mandatory grade for work surfaces that must be used for any commercial or industrial kitchens in many regions, since it doesn't corrode or rust so it can be used for food prep and not become rusty when exposed to salt and water which are the most common kitchen ingredients but also what will make exposed steel or cheap stainless steel to rust. The cybertruck body is made from 300 grade stainless, which will definitely rust when driven in the rust belt during the winter, especially if taken on salted highways in the winter. The choice to use 300 grade stainless maybe because of cost or weight, but the same process is used to fabricate and cut panels to shape 300 grade stainless and it wouldnt be any more difficult to create the body from 316 stainless steel which is actually rust resistant, also easier to clean, and 300 grade stainless is only slightly more durable than just a standard sheet metal. I have a garbage can thats made of higher grade stainless steel than the Cybertruck.",

        "review": "Weather or not a truck is any good depends on how you intend to use it. To me, it's just another tool. I want the most practical truck for my construction business. I don't give a damn about how it looks. Definitely not a fan of Tesla's sloped bed sides - would make putting anything over the side or getting something out of the front of the bed an extreme annoyance and would really piss me off.  If I can't put a 4 x 8 sheet of plywood on the floor of the bed and close the tailgate - useless for my purposes. I punctured a gas tank on a F150 on a rough site - the replacement was about $1,935. To replace the Tesla battery back itself with all modules in it would be around $16,000.  A windshield for a Ford F150 will cost about $700. while the Cybertruck retails for $1,900.  I know it's because of the electronics in the Tesla glass but how do those electronics help my carpenters put more money in my pocket? Now we also have to factor in insurance costs. Insurance companies are steadily raising their rate for EV's because of the ridiculous repair costs. Let's face it, the Tesla truck doesn't seem like it's going to be a long term player in the construction business. More like a novelty item for those that would use it for anything other than your run of the mill pickup.",

        "review": "As a full-size truck owner for the majority of my life, I can honestly say people buy big trucks for one overwhelmingly simple reason:  They're comfortable.  They're not some tiny thing with a harsh, uncomfortable ride, a cramped, claustrophobic interior, little to no headroom, and only space enough for a lunch box or two in the trunk.  Full-size trucks have a very smooth ride, they're quiet, there's plenty of room for everyone to be comfortable, and if/when you need to haul or tow something, you've got that covered.  They're also extremely heavily built and thus pretty safe for those traveling within.  They've also come a long way in terms of design and environmental creature comforts.  They're just better in every way than they used to be 20-30 years ago.  They're also extremely reliable and will last a very, very long time. \n\nSo, yeah, you can get a Raptor or a TRX if you've got the cash, and they're very capable of doing amazing things off road, but they probably never will.  They just look amazing, so people want them, and that's fine.  You don't have to need to haul or tow something in order to justify owning a truck that can do those things.  If you want a vehicle that's safe, comfortable (even luxurious in some trims), and more capable than most things on the road, you buy a full-size truck.  \n\nThe Tesla Model X has been gliding silently through my dreams for years now, and I would dearly love to have one.  The Cybertruck?  I actually like the design, but I don't like that they shrank it so much from the prototype.  I'm sure that won't change, but it'll be interesting to see what does change in the future as these things continue to be mass produced and evolve.",

Thus the move from 70s boats to smaller 80s cars with similar interior space,  better build quality, and higher efficiency.\n\nBasically, what I'm saying is that the Cybertruck is the equivalent of a 1976 Cadillac convertible with horns on the hood (check out Boss Hogg's Cadillac in The Dukes of Hazzard).\n\nIt's all about style, with no attention paid to functionality. It's a joke. \n\nBy contrast, the typical truck is a testament to form following function.\n\nAnd the whole acceleration thing is massively overblown. While every car guy/girl loves speed and power, you're talking about performance you can't use, but which will drain the battery even faster.\n\nWhich brings me to the question of environmental concerns.\n\nHow is a truck that is grossly overweight, has limited cargo space and capacity relative to similarly sized real trucks, and is shaped like a building in any way environmentally responsible?\n\nIt's laughable.\n\nIs it a technical tour de force? Yes. But anyone trying to argue that there's any rational basis for buying this thing is kidding themselves. It's the equivalent of saying a Mustang is a legitimate family car because it has vestigial rear seats.\n\nThe Cybertruck is a \"pickup\", but only in the loosest sense.",

        "review": "That was an interesting chart (How F150 owners use their truck).  Here's one other consideration, when you need to tow something substantial, you REALLY need a truck.  You can't rent a truck unless you sign an agreement that you won't tow anything.  So while only 7% of F-150 owners use their truck for towing, there is no other option.  As far as personal hauling, it's the same thing.  Making renovations to your house?  You need something that can haul a 4' x 8' sheet of plywood, drywall, etc.. I did that with a 20 year old Honda Pilot, a full size SUV, but most SUVs now are too small.\nSo for occasional use the Cybertruck that rides like a nice car is cheaper on fuel than any ICE, roomier than most vehicles and will eventually be reasonably priced, why would you want anything else?  \nHere's why not!  It doesn't have that much range.  If Tesla would have kept their promise of close to 500 miles of range then you would get 200 miles of range while towing in the winter, (loose 50% for towing 10,000 lb holiday trailer and another 10% for winter driving).\nIf they can get the Tesla Semi to have 500 miles of range with a GVW or 80,000 lbs, they could have done it with a CT and a GVW or 30,000 lbs.",

There's a reason cars stopped being made of stainless steel a long time ago, and that's cuz during a crash the force and energy will be transferred to the most fragile things first. When you have a rigid car, the thing that'll crumple first is the soft squishy human body. That's why the hood and trunk of a car is made of aluminum. So that in the event of a crash it'll absorb the impact first instead of the human body. The actual cage of a car is usually steel so that you aren't squished to death, but that also means that T-bones are the most dangerous type of crashes because there's no crumple zone to absorb the impact when you're hit.\n\nOf course, this does come with a downside. You get into a minor crash nowadays, and your car's almost guaranteed to be totaled. But that's also the point. You want the car to crumple around the humans as much as possible so the human doesn't die. It's like that one high school project some kids do where you have to drop an egg in a basket from a roof without having the egg crack by wrapping it in soft stuff like toilet paper. You know what'll happen if you put the egg in a stainless steel bottle then drop it from the roof? That egg's exploding. \n\n\nWhen cars were made of steel accidents at what would be considered low speeds today were still dangerous af. Nowadays you get into an accident at 60 MPH and unless you're unlucky or T-boned people are usually not too badly injured. This monstrosity? Bro hitting a wall at 30MPH will be the equivalent of you sprinting faster than Usain Bolt straight into a wall. Not scary with a normal car, potentially fucking fatal with this shit.",

An interesting one to me is my father's Ram 1500 had an issue where the steering column \"wasn't plugged in fully\" and when it became unplugged (which happened multiple times and one was with a Ram mechanic in the vehicle) the whole truck shut down and he couldn't steer it. He's not wimpy and both of us have dealt with \"heavy truck with no power steering\" and the steering didn't lock up, the steering wheel moved... but the wheels did not. It was described to us as being steering by wire, but I see no sign of that on the internet. So either Ram lied to my father or the Cybertruck isn't actually the first drive by wire vehicle (and I'm not saying the Ram is either). That's my only monologue on the topic.\n\nEverything else mentioned is on point.",

It is iconic due to it being so apparently ugly and so it stands out. \n\nIn my eyes the attraction of road users isn't it's most dangerous part. Obviously the suv type cars are all more dangerous than regular road vehicles. \n\nIt sits too high, gives false illusions of control. Weighs too much. What will happen if it rolls? Do the sharp pointy edges of the car hold up? Or do they simply crush under the weight of the entire battery and suspension system? And to get inside the car quickly in the event of an emergency, you have to wait an extra second to get into the car as it has no physical handles... A handle will always be faster. Nice having a bullet proof car. But when you are getting shot at, that extra second to get into the bulletproof, metal thing, will add up... \n\nIt is a mixed bag. The designers put totally random american stereotypes on the table and said 'let's do it all in one car'. \n\nThen the manipulative and failure of marketing it in any factual or practical way hits the final nail in the coffin. See it as a delorean. Except the cybertruck doesn't have any real character. At least the delorean looked sharp, and was put together with lots of passion. They simply neede way more money. \n\nThe cybertruck designers had all the money they wanted. Tesla doesn't need to target their audience. Their audience targets them. And then they come with such mixed piece of metal angled, so called 'simplicity' or 'minimalism'. Yet not having a problem with making their services overly complex. Hooking you up with all the usual tesla subscriptions to keep your seats heated. In a matter of speaking... \n\nTesla has never really gotten close to the other older, minimalistic cars out there. I haven't seen a Tesla with soul or character. It's all hightech and standing out. That is in no way at all what makes a ferrari or mclaren the beauties they are. It's a hype. Nothing more. And in 30 years we will look back at it and maybe see why it was modest. But nobody will ever understand why it had to be made in the first place. As it has no purpose at all.\n\nThat is what it's lacking. Without purpose you lose all forms of character.",

Of course most of that can, in most cases, also be controlled thru the touch screen or like on my Tesla via stalks.   Also the left scroll wheel allows changing the driver display on my MS to one of a few on the right or left side of the display. Just some examples.  Btw, every 4-5 weeks there is a free OTA software update that keeps making the car more functional and/or sometimes more fun/cool if it's only a cosmetic thing, so the Tesla gets better as time passes.

In other words an expert will never brag they're capable of more than they can do",

The closed minded and most obnoxious of society hate this vehicle, and the rest of us who don't have the time or inclination to hate an inatimate object because it's different (or because of who made it) seem to either love it or at least enjoy a fleeting moment of amusement at something new and creative.
