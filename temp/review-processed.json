It's biggest sin is that they made the frame out of casted aluminum, and they made a heavy duty pick up truck with an aluminum frame and a steel body.",

Europe has almost 2.5x the population as the United States with a lot more infrastructure built over thousands of years. The US also has many things and rights that EU doesn't have or apparently want, which is fine. If the US wants what they have, what right do you have to try and tell them otherwise? Just work on your own country and stop attacking others. I find many of these arguments very pointless and pointless because countries are different and do things differently. Just live your life in your culture and if you don't like the car, then don't buy it. What about the US? Maine's murder rate is 1.03%. What about EU? Latvia has a 4.05%; Finland has a 1.5; Turkey has a 2.46; Estonia has 1.35; Lithuania is 2.21; and Latvia has 2.20.",

I can agree with a lot of those innovative pieces of tech being useful, but did they need to be in a rigid body steel block, that you cannot see out the back of without taking your eyes completely off the road?",

    "I can't imagine what it would cost to repair these trucks after a mild accident. Most body shops have no experience fixing stainless steel body panels. You can't just fill with bondo and color match the paint",
    "I don't think the wacky design will wear off on people when it's mass produced. I see goofy cars like the Nissan Cube all the time and I always think \"why would you buy that?\" Dodge Rams are also getting very popular where I live and I think the same thing.",

    "The design looks like it was inspired by a razor blade and sharks and I'm here for it. Coolest thing on the road!",

    "I can't take this video seriously; the montage of people taking pictures just made me roll my eyes so hard. This review has already aged very poorly in just a few months, but that into is gonna mean less than nothing in like four months when the novelty of seeing one in the wild has worn off and the general public has gotten bored or tired of seeing it. I just kinda feel like if you're not gonna take a product review seriously and be honest and real about it, why do the review at all?",

    "I get what he's saying regarding the towing issue, but what about the other 37% of people who DO want towing? That's still millions of people, right? I think he also missed another aspect that people use trucks for and that is a large bed to transport large things. And the cybertruck's bed just isn't all that large.",

I see this as extremely dangerous and yet the governing bodies decided this was not enough of a public safety issue to care. I guess now we wait for the potential lawsuits from injuries due to the Cybertruck being designed the way it was.",

You can't get out the windows, and tow companies are going to have a hell of a time getting it to a shop of its stuck in park.",

    "I don't know what it is, but this seems like an effort to shift the blame away from a very ill designed car with a huge amount of hazardous errors and bad design. The way it makes other people behave has nothing to do with how it blinds them. The amount of many design flaws, accumulated to make it much much worse, shows you have no concept or idea of what makes something bad.",

    "I'm having trouble deciding if it's more or less responsible to review the Cybertruck with or without discussing Elon Musk's problematic socio-political issues. The reason I would give a thumbs down to a Cyber truck isn't that it's not interesting or even good looking, but that I can't support a man like Elon Musk.",
    "I have no idea how this is legal in the US. What about the rust issues, gas issues, and the truck not working after a few miles? Why not try to go offroad?",
    "I found it a bit problematic, that you looked at it more one sighted. The interior is in a very low quality style, the steal gets dirty and rusty very easily, and buyers have a lot of restrictions with how to clean it and how often.",
    "The design stands out, but for all the wrong reasons. It's an SUV in a shape of a truck, it's bad at everything that a truck should do, it has shoddy build quality, almost all controls are on the touch screen making it very distracing for the driver.",

    "From the testing that's out and the recall that's in it shouldn't have been legal. You cannot beta test on the general public with a car.",

The way that line is closer to the front wheel arch than the back just looks odd to me; also, you'll never see one of these with a cherry picker boom arm in the back; and you won't see one in the frozen areas of the planet because they don't work with thick gloves.",

    "You called the Fisker the worst car you've ever reviewed, but here show that Tesla screwed up the door latch. I hope you keep this video up, because when these over-priced loser-mobiles look like they belong in a post-apocalyptic trash heap, you may be the worst-reviewed reviewer that people have ever heard of.",
    "It changes your steering based on your speed? That sounds dangerous. This isn't a phone or a new way of making fruit smoothies. Cars and trucks are heavy machines, and if they don't respond properly, someone could get seriously hurt or die.",
    "This is iconic of Elon Musk's arrogance and how much it's going to cost Tesla forever. It looks like something they had to throw out after making some stupid sci-fi.",
    "Just saw one of these in Saint Louis and was so confused at what I saw lmao",
    "The stark contrast between this review and Fisker's review is kinda sus. Very curious how a review of BYD would pan out on this channel",

    "I'd never buy this, and overall if someone wants to buy it, I don't care. It's actually great, because it tells me a lot about that person. I now know to never lend them money, because they have poor financial literacy.",

    "Okay.. so what happens to other people you hit? They just die?",
    "The Cybertruck even being in the ballpark of a 911 is insane considering its size and weight. But it beats the 911 at 0-60, the speeds that matter to typical drivers on typical roads.",
    "This is more of an advertisement than an unbiased review.",
    "I feel like people who like this truck don't realize how bad it will be for people walking in cities. When he brings up one person vs four people being unhappy to happy, he isn't recognizing the context of people who don't have to worry about the car vs people who are in a box of steel.",
    "I still think ZZ Top made the PT Cruiser as popular as it became. Not that they endorsed the car in any way, it was just how iconic their own logo with that vehicle style was.",

    "Safety concerns weren't brought up about poor crumple zones, doors that can maim you, or how much momentum it carries, so that anyone hit by the truck would suffer much more damage",
    "Wait, so half a turn of the steering wheel will result in different reaction at low speeds vs high speeds? Am I understanding this correctly? Because it sounds really",
    "A real vehicle, or any other not electric vehicle, will still work perfectly fine in five years. There are cars from the 1940's that even today work perfectly; now this battery toy? In 5 years it will have 50% battery capacity if you are lucky; or your 5 year old cell phone or lithium battery drill still holds full charge in his battery?",

    "Most iconic thing about this vehicle is steering failing just after 14 days of delivery. What a POS.",
    "The truck doesn't do anything they said it would do, and if you wanted to do that, you'd have to pay extra. The truck isn't really bulletproof; it goes through-and-through both doors.",
    "iconic? yes, iconically dumb, iconically unpractical, iconically bad.",
    "I love the variable steering rates and the haptic feedback, but what happens when the car is old and it fails? At least with a mechanical steering wheel, any failure is likely to be a progressive failure that will give you forewarning.",

    "There's a lot of things that you left out of this review that make it feel like you were intentionally going soft of Tesla for one reason or another. The stainless steel panels rust very easily and the panels will start to change colour if exposed to water whilst in the sun. For a truck it has a very tiny bay, no bigger than the average Suzuki light truck. For health and safety reasons it is irresponsible to not accurately communicate how much of a bruising and cutting hazard the sharp steel edges of the doors are.",
    "This thing is dangerous, ugly, and unnecessary. It doesn't bring anything new to any market. It's just a funny looking wannabe tank.",
    "I'll be the next cyclist giving you a thumbs down. This truck and others in its class further endanger pedestrians and cyclists, all for \"the design.\" It's disappointing seeing someone I look up to praise a trend",
    "It is iconic, in that it's a marketing gimmick. It honestly just looks like free advertising on four wheels. But good on them for releasing a concept car into the wild. I'd like to see that more often.",

    "A YouTuber complaining that they get talked to by strangers. Sure. Most people would welcome the attention.",
    "I think the majority of people taking pictures of the cyber truck does it because they think it's cool, but also because it stands out. I think its the same reason people overestimate the price. They think its a limited run car, which it is because Tesla has not been able to make more than 4k of them.",

    "There's already too many SUVs around here and it's honestly becoming a problem on the road and in parking lots. The tech and design to make it functional is cool, but I don't want to see one.",

The idea to make the people good hearted and educated, the society to be sustainable, is what keeps the ICONS alive. Everything other lives quickly and will be forgotten within a few decades or centuries. The Cybertruck will be just a cool truck with a cool story in 10 years, but Elon Musk will be considered as a genius even after 100 years. It is impossible.

    "Great video, thank you sir.",

To replace the Tesla battery back itself with all modules in it would be around $16,000. A windshield for a Ford F150 will cost about $700, while the Cybertruck retails for $1.900.",

    "Felt closer to a marketing video instead of a review",
    "When the Beetle was re-leased as the new Beetle, at first we got so many people stopping to stare at us and wave to us, it was hilarious, but over time it wore off. And I can say the same for the Mini Cooper. Both are older vehicles that have been re-envisioned and yet they were iconic and people were excited to see them.",
    "I reached for my keyboard to comment about my experience owning a first year PT Cruiser and at that moment, you made the comparison. My PT ended up being a lemon and it was bought back. I replaced it with a Grand Cherokee.",

    "This isn't a review. It's a glorified ad. It mentions almost none of the myriad of critical issues in detail, just cramps a few of them in the summary in the end. It is extremely unsafe, it's poor quality, and most importantly it's an idiotic vehicle that",

    "This video is spot on. Really well done.",

    "I'd  be more excited to see Marques behind the wheel",
    "Full-size trucks have a smooth ride, quiet, and plenty of room for everyone to be comfortable. They're also extremely heavily built and thus pretty safe for those traveling within. They've come a long way in terms of design and environmental creature comforts. You don't have to need to haul or tow something in order to justify owning a truck that can do those things. The Tesla Model X has been gliding silently through my dreams for years now, and I would dearly love to have one.",
    "Lack of mention of security is concerning, especially about pedestrian safety. It is the best MKBHD video, but it is not the best video far from it.",

You and the team do such an incredible job from creating such fun and engaging graphics to beautiful shots that are so simple but so well done! The intentionality of it all does not go unnoticed and it's so fun to watch you continue to push the boundaries.",
    "I was surpised and also disappointed that the word \"security\" was never seriously mentioned. This review felt rather incomplete on more than one end.",

    "There's a reason cars stopped being made of stainless steel a long time ago. During a crash the force and energy will be transferred to the most fragile things first. When you have a rigid car, the thing that'll crumple first is the soft squishy human body. The actual cage of a car is usually steel so that you aren't squished to death, but that also means that T-bones are the most dangerous type of crashes because there's no crumpled zone to absorb the impact when you're hit.",

It doesn't have a cleaning mechanism like the front camera, so in winter you'll have to drive with the tonneau cover down, which is just regular winter driving stuff.",

    "It's a symbol for wasteful, unsafe and ugly design,. Worst car of the century in many ways, just innately stupid.",

    "Why does this feel like your best mastered video? All over, the online and audio sound and look great. Did you go to a post house?",
    "It's like people decided to make the car big, and people will buy it because \"hey this car is big\" so the cycle repeats endlessly. Cars just look like you fused five different cars together.",
    "I see a back to the future reboot using this as the time machine.",
    "The last thing we need on the roads is more huge trucks. They make city streets unsafe, and they take up too much space. Can understand trucks being used for commercial purposes, but if you are using one as a daily driver, especially one that is not good for commercial use, you are a bit of a wanker.",

    "Ahh yes, more Cybertruk click bait. Just what the doctor ordered.",
    "You won't be fine if you get hit as the car is too rigid to be actually safe in an accident. It also puts in more danger smaller vehicles, not to mention pedestrians or cyclists.",
    "Dude, I really get why you're the best at this. Fantastic presentation. ",
    "I feel like this will be an iconic vehicle for all the wrong reasons. Quality of fit in the first models, reliability of initial models, potential danger to other road users, and sycophantic behavior to hype this truck in a time when the owner is acting in such an unhinged way.",

    "My father's Ram 1500 had an issue where the steering column wasn't plugged in fully, and when it became unplugged, the whole truck shut down and he couldn't steer it. Both of us have dealt with \"heavy truck with no power steering\" and the steering didn't lock up, the steering wheel moved, but the wheels did not.",

    "I don't have words to describe how stupid and pointless I think this vehicle is. At best it gives me something to laugh at rich people for.",
    "If it is going to run into the same problems as the other Tesla cars has had with battery problems, finding charging stations in more than one town and being charged more money to charge it than buying gas, then what is the point of buying one?",
    "16:00 Non-americans don't undestand anything in this table. So yes, the Cybertruck is slow in km/h after a few meters.",
    "You will be fine. Typical American way of thinking. If you even consider not killing the neighbors daughter with your tank, you are considered a communist.",
    "I know this is about tech, but MKBHD's ability to ignore and overlook everything that Elon Musk is and who he is as a person is astonishing, really. You're not co-signing Elon's politics and views by buying a Tesla, but praising his products on a high traffic platform like this so much makes you wonder about their stance on many social issues today.",
    "6:39 \nIt's not bulletproof.\nIt's been demonstrated",
    "In the automotive sphere, classic cars, the Mustang, the F-150, the Wrangler were icons that embodied the American desire to Tinker. This Tinkering kept the American people free. Tesla has killed this, and other manufacturers are following. We are no longer free.",

    "This is easily one of the best and highest quality videos I have ever seen, seriously. The cinematic quality, the shots switching back and forth so seamlessly, the way Marques speaks; everything.",
    "It's dangerous, it's a stupid design, and it's heavy. It's as though Elon Musk became a truck. It is not sustainable and certainly not environmentally friendly.",

    "I was given the first of the new VW Beetles when I was in Los Angeles decades ago. It was a blast to drive as it got a lot of attention. A trip of 30 minutes would take double because of getting \"boxed in\" on the freeways by camera happy drivers",

    "Just because a car was made in big numbers doesn't mean it's iconic or has a weird style or such. No one thinks about the PT cruiser except fans of the car, and no one except fans will know and care in a few years. When everyone knows what a cybertruck is, it will be iconic.",
    "He correctly points out the buggy Fisker software that people paid for, but forgets to mention the completely missing autopilot feature.",

    "I think it looks cool and futuristic!",
    "The truck may fail, but it will become a classic instantly regardless. It's going to be up there with the likes of the Lamborghini Countach, Ferrari F40, Nissan Skyline Coupe GTR, and Toyota Supra.",
    "The obsessive \"minimalism\" is my biggest pet peeve with Tesla. Rear visibility on the Cybertruck is so bad. It's safety/ergonomic negligence that they don't put a screen for the back up camera in the mirror.",
    "I feel like you skirted around the fact that this is a deathtrap for anyone outside the car. I see you trying subtle mentions, but who cares about fly by wire when it's hitting a cyclist with bulletproof steel?",
    "I finally saw one of these in real life, and I couldn't stop myself from laughing.",

    "I doubt the Cybertruck has any true backup system if the steer-by-wire fails. All I see are electrical redundancies, no actual mechanical steering.",
    "The design and engineering of the cybertruck is iconic, but don't believe it is the first to come up with steer by wire system in a production car. Steering by wire has been an option in Nissan infinity models since 2013.",
    "Those are not the same tires you can buy with the same name or that come on the trucks you mentioned. These are a special Cybertruck-specific Goodyear tire that has the tread shaved down.",
    "I remember the first time I saw a Model 3 in Seattle, it felt iconic then. After years of mass production, it's no more special seeing",
    "The last few minutes of this video are very interesting. The PT Cruiser by Chrysler versus the Cyber Truck by Tesla is the difference. The expectations from consumers going forward will be that Tesla is associated with a brand that is going to send humans to Mars.",

    "I feel that the Cybertruck is only about the design. Steer-by-wire, 800V architecture or clever air suspension are not the cars selling point. The design, on the other hand, is.",
    "Seeing Marques make excuses for the Cybertruck and ignore all the other issues and complaints that have been coming up is just sad. Basically just a hype man for Elon at this point",

    "In my eyes the attraction of road users isn't it's most dangerous part. The designers put totally random American stereotypes on the table and said 'let's do it all in one car' The failure of marketing it in any factual or practical way hits the final nail in the coffin. I haven't seen a Tesla with soul or character. It's all hightech and standing out. That is in no way at all what makes a Ferrari or a McLaren the beauties they are. It is hype. Nothing more. In 30 years we will look back at it and maybe see why it was modest, but nobody will ever understand why it had to be made in the first place.",
    "People often complain about no knobs and switches on Teslas. Teslas handle all kinds of verbal commands to do things buttons and switches would, like turning on the wipers or making the AC/heater less cold/warm. Also has scroll wheels on the steering wheel to change audio volume or change fan speed.",
    "A physical button is better until you don't need it or need an extra one. You can't constantly update physical buttons or make them better, that's why they're worse. Do you think phones should go back to keypads",

    "The only modern looking and innovatively designed car for 70 years.\nZero to One.\nAll other cars are just boring legacy auto.",
    "The Porsche comparison is so tiring. The towing test was done against a BASE NON TURBO. Why is that so hard to understand?",
    "A truck will kill people as more of them hit the roads. The driver will always be safe mostly, but imagine a bike or two wheeler colliding with the Razorblade of a \"truck\".",
    "I see where you are trying to go, but it's hard to compare the Cybertruck to the PT Cruiser. The PT Cruiser wasn't an innovative vehicle; it just had a unique look at the time. So",

    "Just watched on of your first videos and then watched this one. Its insane how far youve come when it comes to quality.",

    "Dude this is the best review ever in the history of mankind I  you @mkbhd.",

    "The blue hoodie is so clean. anyone got an ID?",
    "This culture of cars is damaging our environment. What we should do is move away from using massive cars to move one person and instead have more public transport alternatives around the world.",

    "This video was very well scripted. Thank you and the team for making so great content.",
    "Some people get distracted by the bulletproof part. It's just a way to highlight that the truck has a rugged exterior, which is one of the two key selling points of pickups. It wasn't designed to be bullet proof.",
    "I've been selected to pick up my reservation, but I don't want it anymore. I would have liked to just sell it, but that seems to be a big nono.",
    "What aspect ratio are you using for the video? Because with my phone it fit perfectly. It's not too small and it's not taking all the screen... It's just right!",
    "The most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck is that it will cut off your finger, or your child's fingers, if the door shuts on them. Everything will stain the \"Stainless\" steel. Lots of soaps and chemicals, bird poop, and on and on.",
    "None of the footage made on the road seems real; the car looks so different that I can't wrap my mind around the fact",

    "If you talk to a stranger who describes your vehicle looking 'crazy, like a movie prop, alien, I'm not sure you can count those as positive remarks. It's just a polite way of not calling your purchase ugly.",

    "I would love to see a video on your production process again. From backstage looks to you on camera.",
    "yeah i think most people would have the same reaction if they saw a koenigsegg or a pagani where most 0people dive a scaped altima",
    "The thumb showing Marques in the blindspot of a hulking steel knife on wheels is NOT iconic.",
    "I just know they loved that B roll of the cybertruck between two semis",
    "This thing has that predator vibe... Lions still have that revere even in their nimbers",
    "I love and hate listening to someone brag about how capable their 4x4 is. The less they know about off-roading, the more capable they think their vehicle is. An expert will never brag they're capable of more than they can do.",
    "It's iconic to me too, but even without the rare factor :) Awesome video & Thanks :)",
    "I thought it was funny when I watched your last video. My door won't shut all the way.",
    "A very good review. Thank you, Marques",
    "If the truck won't turn on, your only option is to tow it with a tow rope, how do you steer it?",
    "I have a motorcycle that is called the Beast, the super Duke 1290. It has its detractors because of the futuristic sharp angle looks it has, but the amount of people that want me to rev the throttle on it says that people love the looks. I use my grand Cherokee for hauling my tools around.",
    "I don't really care about the cybertruck; it's not going to be a vehicle I'll ever see in my country. Nobody here uses a pickup truck, except landscaping companies. I don't like Elon Musk; he's a moronic person; no one should support him with",
    "A mixture of hydrogen peroxide with a small amount of vinegar and salt will speed up the rusting process.",
    "Bicyclist, a member of one of the most obnoxious groups of people in the world, would openly express their dislike of this vehicle, while a group of normal people in a car loved it. Both could've rode right by without externalising their opinion of it, but one chose to express positivity and the other negativity.",
    "I would sincerely be delighted if Tesla made an aluminum version with softer edges and available with the standard colors of their other vehicles. I would hope that a material change would also lower the cost of production tooling and provide a cost savings for those looking for an alternative EV truck.",
    "I hate the way the cybertruck looks, and I don't particularly like tesla, but I'd say it's pretty iconic.",
    "If you're 6'2, you have to contort to get in the front, and you can't sit in the back. Massive pillars impede visibility, and terrible viz out the rear.",
    "I find it fascinating how electric cars are making manufacturers to think outside of the box. But here we are, why make a car with a classic form dictated, more or less, to buy engine under the hood?",
    "I bought a 2010 Kia Soul in May of 2009 and it must have been one of the first in the Seattle area. For a good year and a half it was fun watching people do a double take while driving down the street.",

    "Will you ever speak to the fact that Tesla is dropping the ball and the car is unreliable as hell? Or will you just ignore this",
    "I don't know if you were racing each other or just the clock, but the but truck got a much better launch.",
    "At first they were unique, but now no-one cares if they see one on the road. The only thing about regular teslas is to conclude if the owner is a smug douche or not",
    "At first, people didn't know if they should love it or hate it, but then it became everyone's go-to and every company did the same thing. At first it looked foreign and unique, now it is iconic and something everyone has.",
    "Yesterday I saw one in my town and it was the most ugly vehicle I have seen in my 58 years. It looked much worse in person. I'm not saying it is a bad vehicle, but I wouldn't be seen in one.",

    "Such a great video man, such a wholesome video. I was thinking if there are millions of videos on this and I have watched every single one of them, what different is this video going to do? But yet again marques pulls up something interesting that you eagerly feel like watching.",
    "The truck looks cool but it doesnt at the same time. Idk, I would get one if I could though. Its like that weird cool",
    "Any other company providing something in such a state would get ridiculed. The panel gaps, trunks that can cut your fingers off, most stain-able car in existence, steering wheel that falls apart after two months.",
    "Only thing I hate about CT is that it's a truck. The design language, the tech, it's all awesome, but they had to make yet another chubby",

    "24:17 no way the ratio of joy to disgust is 80/20. Every person I talk to hates it",
    "Xiaomi SU7 review next????",
    "Kinda laughing that this one isn't on Autofocus. Marques saves the smaller channel for Fisker. Don't waste those Tesla views!",
    "Jesus dude, it was not a panel gap.  You really are not paying attention.",
    "It's still a fact that cars are only used 6% of their total life. The average American drives 30 miles per day only.",
