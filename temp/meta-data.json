I'm not a fan of the exterior. Looks like a big box on wheels with very sharp lines.  In the video you can see all the fingerprints around the doors. I would have been interested to see the interior and safety features. It did show a huge info screen......like someone's big screen home television. If I was an owner, I would get very tired of the look and novelty of this truck. It really is funny how these huge trucks (both gas and electric) are primarily used for just shopping around town or taking the kids to school. Oh well...to each his own.",

Just about two weeks ago I was going for a walk and I saw this car park on the street where I was walking (i live in an affluent town) and I looked at it as though I saw a ghost \ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc7b It looked like a UFO car or something that you'd see in a James Bond movie. I turned around trying to figure out what that hell was that. I saw no logo of Tesla \ud83e\udd2d so I had to google it to find out. I am not a car person as I drove my Honda Civic for 19 years and the only reason I decide to trade it in is because during winter my door froze and I was stuck inside the car until I kicked it open \ud83d\ude20 I got a whopping $700 for my trade in. ....Oh well two day ago this car was again parked outside a sandwich shop....so I have seen this car twice!!! Why is this called a truck? It sure looks like a car!",

        "review": "I don't know why people get the idea that hospital bills in the US are insane here inside this comment section. My mother uses Medicare and is absolutely fine (it is there for people who apply for it but people don't apply for it). I have insurance as well, which would have been paid by taxes anyways that I'd have to put into if we had your style of system. Are there issues with the healthcare system? Yes. Is Europe absolutely perfect with its healthcare, despite how much funding goes into it? No. It has many flaws. \r\n\r\nThese black and white blanket statements are rather silly. Every country has their pros and cons. Europeans don't understand that the US itself is ALMOST as large as all of Europe combined. Imagine driving from the top most point of Europe to the southern most point and see how long that would take you. We have far larger surface area to get to places and different issues because of it. One country has to deal with a very tiny amount of road space compared to the US. We have much larger roads so it can accommodate trucking because it is how we can best get inventory all across of the nation (think of trying to do that for all of Europe with our size comparison). \r\n\r\nWe also have a different culture and different interests. We have many, many different cultures within the US. You go one state over and you'll find a ton of differences in way of thinking and doing things. It would be better to compare the US by states like you do European countries because that is what it would be like for size comparison. You should compare healthcare by state to other EU countries healthcare. And not every EU healthcare is that great, let's be honest. And Europe has almost 2.5x the population as the United States with a lot more infrastructure built over thousands of years. How can you compare that to a country as young as the US. Let's be honest here.\r\n\r\nCrime rate? \r\n\r\nLuxembourg has a murder rate of 1.39 per 100,000 people.\r\nLatvia has a 4.05%.\r\nFinland has a 1.5%.\r\nTurkey has a 2.46%.\r\nEstonia has a 1.35%.\r\nLithuania is 2.21%.\r\n\r\nWhat about the US?\r\n\r\nMaine's murder rate is 1.03% WHAT?! No way! Lower than EU ?!\r\nNew Hampshire is 1.26%\r\nConnecticut is 1.5%\r\nMississippi is 2.45%\r\nKentucky is 2.14%\r\n\r\nIs the US generally less safe than Europe? Yes. We also have many things and rights that EU doesn't have or apparently want, which is fine. People will vote and choose to live how they want. If the US wants what they have then what right do you have to try and tell them otherwise. EU is far from perfect. Just as the US is far from perfect. Work on your own country and stop attacking others. Maybe you'll make your home a better place to live rather than typing random stuff on a video you probably should never have watched to begin with since it doesn't sell to you.\r\n\r\nI find many of these arguments very pointless. Countries are different and do things differently. Why you won't conform to the way the US does things the US won't conform to the way you do things. Just live your life in your culture and if you don't like the car, then don't buy it. I don't know why you'd be on this video if it isn't something you're invested in getting. It just feels like hate mobbing, throwing hatred at something you, as you say, never see where you're from. Why can't people just enjoy things that they enjoy? If people like the big truck and a place allows it and the voters are fine with it in that country, then let it be.",

I figured I was somewhere between 150k-200k based on some articles I read at the time. The recent recalls where they are forced to publish figures suggest Tesla made some 12K trucks by July 2024. So, how did I get invited unless like 80-90% dropped out?!\n2. I am looking on CarGurus now and the Cyberbeast, which is like 131k for the tag, is being sold in multiple states for 140k-143k which is a modest premium and is almost breakeven\n\nDoes this sound like what was advertised? I think I have another 2-3 months before they call me for the final payment and delivery but this is starting to look like a major flop and I might have to walk away since cheaper to let go of the deposits than pick up a car which could be depreciating like the rest of the Teslas. Where can I see reliable information on how many cars they made and how many preorders still exist?\n\nAlso, was considering renting it on Turo for like $350-400/day. Thoughts on the feasibility?",

Too many reviews where you fall over yourself to manufacture an enthusiasm about something that is obviously very flawed, to the point of glossing over and sometimes outright ignoring a lot of glaring issues. From the beginning I already couldn't take this video seriously, the montage of people taking pictures just made me roll my eyes so hard, especially with the hindsight that most of those folks were almost certainly taking pictures to make fun of it to their friends later. And to call that the \"most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck\" while speeding past it's more minor, well-known issues and then not addressing any of the other more serious problems that make this hunk of junk as unsafe as it is. This review has already aged very poorly in just a few months, but that into is gonna mean less than nothing in like four months when the novelty of seeing one in the wild has worn off and the general public has gotten bored or tired of seeing it. Hell, if anything the more real \"danger\" is that I'd be willing to bet a significant amount of drivers will be nastier to and more inclined to drive aggressively around a Cybertruck than other vehicles. \n\nI just kinda feel like if you're not gonna take a product review seriously and be honest and real about it, why do the review at all?\n\nHaven't seen the video you did about it for your car review channel, hoping that one is better but I'm not holding my breath. Tbh I might just skip it.",

Not only that, but Elon is selling cars allegedly to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but has joined forces with a political party that has worked to prevent any Climate legislation for 40 years.

The tires were damaged from the wheel covers, the dash panel was warped for some reason, and the bedcover was crooked. Also, I found out from the owner that this thing is so dangerous it can\u2019t pass European safety standards. The leeway given in these reviews by Marques, saying future builds will fix all of these issues, is mind blowing to me. Especially, given the inconsistency in his criticism compared to other product reviews\u2026 Tearing other products apart for not launching in the condition for which they were promised by the company before launch, but in this video he just makes excuses again and again for all of the glaring problems and missing features when it comes to this literally poorly made steel death machine. It\u2019s kind of astounding. Personally, I did find the drive by wire steering to be the best thing about the cybertruck after driving it. But they could have put that technology in anything else that wasn\u2019t just poorly designed and poorly manufactured in so many other respects. I honestly question Marques\u2019 ethical principles as a reviewer after watching these cybertruck reviews in comparison to his other reviews. Just disappointing.",

What is the actual towing or off-road capability of the Cybertruck? You didn't say, but instead essentially invalidated the question, telling us we don't care. You say it steers well, which is an actual car review thing, but never talk about the size of the bed of the truck, or the comfort of the backseats. As has been mentioned the most iconic car design has always been the Volkswagen Beetle - affordable and everywhere for decades.  The Cybertruck may be iconic in the way the PT Cruiser is iconic - a full-sized toy of limited use for people desperate to impress people they pass on the street but don't know.",

A truck that is more dangerous to everyone around it AND the people inside it compared top most vehicles on the road, that has horrific quality control issues, rusts if you look at it funny, AND it blinds people nearby thanks to it being a glare magnet.\n\nI mean it is iconic, for being an absloute disaster.\n\nAlso its not surprising that a tech channel didnt even touch on how dangerous sharp angles are to pedestrians, but it is dissapointing. Cars are a massive killer and making one of the deadliest types of car (pickup trucks) even deadlier for looks especially when most pickup truck owners dont need to own one. Most of the need is better served by vans and for the bit where a pickup truck is needed, the bedspace of modern (especially teslas) pickup trucks is bs. \n\nOh also bulletproof steel? its bullet resistence is far overstated. \n\nPersonal vehicles dont exist in a vacuum and glossing over its myriad of flaws is promoting a vehicle that is unnecessarily dangerous just because, and it is not fine because it looks good, it makes streets mroe dangeorus, it makes congestion worse, it does mroe damage to roads, and for what, it looking cooler?",

        "review": "A few things you left out in this video: \n1 The bulletproof exterior isn't just overrated, its dangerous. Cars are made to crumple so that the kinetic energy, the force of the crash goes through the car itself instead of your body. Whiplash at best and seriously injured at worst from a simple crash. \n2 You did not mention the \"Car wash mode\" at all. They did not make the seals to the power points well enough to keep water out so they made that mode to close those parts and protect the car. But if you have adhd like me or just having a stressful/busy day, you will forget and brick your 'truck'. Not to mention I've seen posts about this happening and it will void the warranty so you're screwed. \n3 You did mention that the windows are stronger than normal but, specifically they are meant to be shatterproof. Sure this is great if you live in a high crime area but, what would happen if you went off a bridge? I can't say ive seen one submerged so i don't know exactly how it would go, but normal procedure is, unbuckle, grab something for breaking the window and bust out the back windshield. How are you going to do that with this? \n4 You didn't mention a common problem with Tesla cars in general, that the doors are completely powered by the battery. ( Some may be different, i don't know ) And there are many reports of their battery dying for one reason or not, and becoming unable to get in or out of the car. If this 'truck' were to have this problem, how would you get out/back in? You can't get out the windows thats for sure, and tow companys are going to have a hell of a time getting it to a shop of its stuck in park.\nI can understand if maybe you didn't want to include these because they specifically weren't your experience, but they should atleast have a footnote in the video instead of completely ignored. (These issues are just from a couple other videos I've seen and im sure there will be more.)",

An the same goes for any other car you carsh with, the cyber truck absorbs no force in said impact compared to normal cars. That, and wind resistance is also a factor in efficiency as you said. The point is, no one is making them like that because they're smarter than tat. An being iconic in exchange for being less safe, not worth it. Also, it's iconic, but ugly, that's just that.",

Nobody is talking about the obvious safety issues of using steel body panels. It's not just pedestrians who will suffer more if you hit them. Without crumple zones and deliberately designed energy transferring body panels the Cybertruck stands to act as a death trap for the drivers and passengers inside. It's unbelievable that higher safety standards don't already exist in the USA which would have prevented the current Cybertruck design from ever being allowed on a public road.",

Everything that is extraordinary (whether new, old, rare or custom) attracts attention. \"'Towing', 'transporting' and 'off-roading' (...)\" - This is a sobering assessment of how useful a car like this really is, which will probably only be used as a means of transport by the millions of pre-orderers. \"And that's ok.\" Why criticise when there's actually nothing to criticise? A big truck with a trailer is also not suitable for picking up your child from school or driving to the supermarket to do the shopping, but it's OK! Of course 'freedom' is ok and the fascination of possibilities, but if you also consider other 'iconic' features as a selling point (shockproof, bulletproof), do US-Americans have to survive everywhere like in 'Escape from New York'?! Also no crumple zone - so me first even if I'm at fault in an accident, even then - that can really hurt.\nDon't get me wrong, I think it's cool and I'd love to drive and own one, but it's just nonsensical.

Its a SUV in a shape of a truck (because its bad at everything that a truck should do), it has shoddy build quality (just look at the discolered doors - that can't be intentional), almost all controls are on the touch screen making it very distracing for the driver to use. And thats all aside from the design, which is controverial and I peronally don't like it, but I can see how somebody else can like it, even if its just for the novelty.\nSo I all you want is essentially a SUV with a extravagant design and care more about how you are seen on the road than what the car actually does for you, its the car for you.",

        "review": "Idk Mk there's a lot of things that you left out of this review or at least could have mentioned that make it feel like you were intentionally going soft of Tesla for one reason or another:\n1. The stainless steel panels rust very easily (anything from dead bugs to bird droppings can lead to rusting) and the panels will start to change colour if exposed to water whilst in the sun (something like the second CT at 26:01).\n2. To avoid the rusting problem Tesla charges 5k to put a protective coating on the panels which they should have put on it in the first place\n3. The panels are not fucking bulletproof\n4. Drag racing it is pretty dumb if you are not going to be towing stuff either. One could argue that the people who buy the CT are more likely to tow something than ever be in any form of race with it.\n5. For a truck it has a very tiny bay, no bigger than the average Suzuki light truck, this is a very important bit of information considering how that bay size dictates how much you can potentially carry. You didn't at all dwell on this part and only briefly touched on it by saying you and your crew use it to move your equipment but exactly how much equipment was that bro? Surely you caould have taken 2 or 3 minutes to just show how many grocery bags or suitcases can fit in the bay and taken 2 or 3 less minutes glazing the \"iconic design\" \n6. For health and safety reasons it is entirely irresponsible to not accurately communicate how much of a bruising and cutting hazard the sharp steel edges of the doors actually are, I have seen videos of carrots getting sliced and chopped against the edges of the door, they're like fucking katanas \ud83d\ude02.\nAnyway, I hope in a year or so we can get a more well rounded review from you tackling the issues I've just highlighted, especially number 6 because if anyone who owns a toddler has designs on buying this dumb truck, they should at least know that it comes with the possibility of leaving their toddler devoid of a finger or two.",

For me I think the answer is No. Strip away the novelty of the angles and profiles, and no one 20 years down the line is going to call out the shape of that rear end as their inspiration for a new vehicle. No kid's gonna carry around stats for the Cybertruck in their head. The classics are cars that kids today still long for and dream about when they've seen them. A Countach could come out today and very little about it would be considered behind the times. A Cybertruck is going to look dated fairly quickly imo.\n\nIt's gonna be sitting in collections as an oddity for sure, but I have to wonder if all the compromises in the way it's built will mean very many of them are even running 25 years from now.",

The biggest potential problem is the owner of the company.  Nothing that man says can be trusted.  The vehicle may have some fetching features BUT latching hardware falling off?  Not good.  Recall of 100% of these trucks due to accelerator pedal experiencing rapid unscheduled disassembly (thankfully unlike the SpaceX RUD it truck doesn't blow up it just falls apart).  Marques, you didn't mention the rusty \"stainless\".  How long will you wait to get these damn things repaired?  In the past the wait was horrendous.  Marques, I hope you enjoy carefree miles in your new ride but I think you have been too kind to a problematic manufacturer.\n\nBefore you attribute this to \"teething problems\", German Teslas were experiencing much higher that typical failure to pass inspection just three years after purchase.  Good luck to anybody that buys a Tesla.",

        "review": "Owning (or wanting to own) a Cybertruck is the new Mid-Life Crisis cry for help/desperate bid to be relevant. It's like a 2006 Honda Ridgeline drawn by a 4 year old made by a company whose grifter CEO acts like a 5 year old. Tesla was already the epitome of 'Form over Function' due to prioritizing aesthetics and high profit margins (for example, by removing radar and ultrasonic sensors for cheaper optical cameras), but this model takes that to a new low by having a hideous form. I've seen several in person (both standard and ones with wraps), and they're hideous and ridiculous. The production quality is predictably horrible (the production issues as addressed in the video are inexcusable for such a tiny run of *luxury* vehicles), repairs are absurdly expensive, and the brake lights don't work properly. The actual utility of it (as mentioned in the video) is laughable because it has low towing power,  you can't fit much in the truck bed, it has difficulty going up inclines that over vehicles climb with ease, the range is significantly less than advertised, the battery compartment is only half full, and it needs to be cleaned off shortly after getting wet. Tesla even says you shouldn't take it through a car wash! It's not bulletproof except against a small percentage of handguns, and the height and design of the vehicle makes it difficult to see pedestrians in front of you. Yoke steering wheels are also a known safety hazard. But hey, you do you I guess.\n\nAnother fun fact is that working at Tesla is dangerous because the company is infamous for ignoring safety best practices in their factories because Musk hates the color yellow, doesn't like safety signs, and doesn't like beeping noises. Not sure why he even cares what the factories look like, since he's not an engineer, he apparently doesn't care about the condition Tesla vehicles leave the factories in, and he's on Twitter all the time anyway.",

        "review": "In the current age of mass information - nothing material can be iconic. There is nothing that is unbelievable or not seen before. The social networks made the sharing of ideas available for absolutely every person in the world. The inventions became just trends, the misteries became debunked in the comments, the heroes became influencers in order to monetize their status. And that is fine - just this is the product of the reality, that we live in. If there was Instagram during the Trojan War, Achilles would be a viral star and he will leave Hector alive, so can make a podcast with him later on youtube. Last week I was exploring Milano. During one of the evenings I was waiting the metro to arrive and there were multiple screens on the walls of the station. They were showing the Pope reading statesments about the situation in Israel. And on the bottom there was a banner with a brief information. On the left it was written \"PAPA\", which is Pope in italian. But not \"the Pope\" (Il Papa), not Pope Francis, but just \"PAPA\". There were around 50 people around. May be I was the only one who was watching the broadcast with the Pope. Nobody was interested at all and this is in Italy. Can you imagine in 15 or 16th Century, what it would be to see and listen to the pope. One of a kind experience in your life, almost like a devine moment. Now some influencers who give money if you are the last one leaving a red circle on the ground, are more important for the people than the pope. But here is the difference. Nobody is interested in Mr Beast as a human, or even as a YouTube genius. 99% are interested in his money and his exposure. You need him either to earn easy money, or to receive gigantic advertising, hence again earn a lot of money. When the legend has a price it turns to a bestseller. Mr Beast is not and he will never be an icon. The CyberTruck is not and it will never be an icon. Not in the Today's world. It is impossible. The money are the God of Internet and \"in GOD we TRUST\" (TRUST not Believe). The Saint halo is a \"Verified\" badge. That is what you need to see in order to be sure that this is the real \"devine\" person. There is this show on NG \"The best of the decades\"... and they show the icons of each DECADE. Icon for a decade? Some of the saints are icons for 2000 years.  This is what happens when you bind the virtues with money. The future of the human kind doesn't rely on how popular we are, it relies on how sustainable we are as a society. The real science knowledge, the real art and the real life virtues brought us to the 21st Century. Only if you are considered a true genius in those 3 life aspects, you can become a true icon. The Cybertruck will be just a cool truck with a cool story in 10 years, but Elon Musk will be considered as a genius even after 100 years. Elon is the Icon, not the Cybertruck. Nobody remembers who was a millionaire in Salzburg in the times of Mozart, but Mozart is still considered one of the greatest geniuses of the Music for all times. Nobody speaks about the wealthy nobles who ordered Da Vinci to paint for them. But Da Vinci is still considered as a science and an art genius for almost 500 years already. And that is their purpose - to give the human kind a good future, or we will extinct. The human kind exists for around a million years, and our modern world and society exists only for two Centuries. We are frighteningly close to reverse the process. The idea to make the people good hearted and educated, the society to be sustainable, is what keeps the ICONS alive. Everything other lives shortly and will be forgotten.",

All it means is that it's easily recognizable, and since I actually saw one on the road, you can recognize that POS from a mile away.  lol.  Also - being mass produced.... that's a bit of a leap.

I don't blame people for liking the concept.  it's different, weird, and shiny, and people like shiny new objects, even if they're garbage.  :/",

        "review": "Electric Car Company Loses over $500m after Customers Reviews.\n\nA YouTuber, Marques Brownlee using the MKBHD handled reviewed an electric car called Fisker and on his YouTube channel, shared his damning observations of the car. \n\nHe did this despite the car company asking him to wait for the software update that they said was coming to the vehicle.\n \nAccording to MKBHD, he is reviewing it because the company had made the product public and was actually selling to customers.\n\nFollowing his review where he called it the worst car he has ever reviewed, which had over 4 million views and other inefficiencies of the car company, Fisker has now recorded a net loss of over $500m. There are mutterings that the company may go bankrupt.\n\nIt happened that his review was reechoed by the users of the car with less platform.\n\nAnd where is MKBHD today, surprisingly, he is still a free man with the right to call any product crap with his reasons in so far as he bought it and is sharing his honest perspective as a user.\n\nNigerians are struggling to relate to this because if MKBHD was in Nigeria, he will be arrested first and fellow citizens will defend it because MKBHD does not know what it takes to build a business.\n\n*********************\nNote: The car company lied about some features that are not there. An integrity issue. They also sold a product that was not ready not minding the risks this poses for their customers. Nigerians want to wait until people died before they do Quality Assurance.\n\nGot this from Ayo Ademokoya's wall.",

I can't really talk about safety, cause I don't know anything about it, so I'll just stick to common sense: cars are heavy as fuck. The difference between this and a regular car panel will be negligible when you're talking in terms on tonnes. The inside bits, the actual structure of the car, matters more. And I'll leave that to NCAP tests etc. Stainless steel changes nothing.\n\nAnd when it comes to fender bender... well, again; the difference will be negligible when you're talking in terms on tonnes. Any collision that would result in a dent on a normal car will dent this. The only pro is that it isn't painted, but that's not actually a pro, cause it will rust... It won't even be worth its weight in scrap 10 years from now. And who know how much they're gonna sell spare panels for.\n\nAnd this may be an unpopular opinion (j/k), but something COSTING $60.000 SHOULD NOT HAVE AN OPEN BETA!

Everything you\u2019re describing about the cyber truck was reaction. I was receiving with this Chrysler PT Cruiser other people loved it or hated it. That same summer I drove my grandmother and grandfather back to Chihuahua M\u00e9xico in order to pick up my grandmother\u2018s diabetes prescription. I wish I had a dash cam too show the amount of attention we received in Chihuahua Mexico. Obviously the PT cruiser ended up as a design exercise for Chrysler at the time and now no one cares about this little vehicle. But at the time we felt like celebrities driving this unique vehicle in the early 2000s.",

Ironically I would bet that it will eventually end up in a Chinese metal and electronics recycling facility. Industrial dishwashers are made from higher grade stainless steel than the body of that truck. Anyone with knowledge of metal compositions can tell you that stainless steel has several grades and anything other than 316 grade stainless steel which is the highest grade, 316 grade stainless steel is actually mandatory grade for work surfaces that must be used for any commercial or industrial kitchens in many regions, since it doesn't corrode or rust so it can be used for food prep and not become rusty when exposed to salt and water which are the most common kitchen ingredients but also what will make exposed steel or cheap stainless steel to rust. The cybertruck body is made from 300 grade stainless, which will definitely rust when driven in the rust belt during the winter, especially if taken on salted highways in the winter. The choice to use 300 grade stainless maybe because of cost or weight, but the same process is used to fabricate and cut panels to shape 300 grade stainless and it wouldnt be any more difficult to create the body from 316 stainless steel which is actually rust resistant, also easier to clean, and 300 grade stainless is only slightly more durable than just a standard sheet metal. I have a garbage can thats made of higher grade stainless steel than the Cybertruck.",

The angles on this thing are dangerous to peds, cyclists, and smaller vehicles. I cannot get past the potential dangerousness of it to enjoy it otherwise. It's not only this truck. But the trend amongst makers of mid/large SUV'S and trucks to have these blunted (vs sloping front ends) making them appear more like large tractor trailer trucks is ridiculous. I have a Jeep and a Miata (that was rear ended today by a Chevy truck with this design) and in the two seater, drivers of these vehicles bear down very aggressively with their lights blinding me. My partner and I have had several rear and side enders with these trucks. She was driving today when it happened. I spoke with a coworker who had a similar vehicle and rides motorcycles and he emphatically voiced the same concerns. We both love two and four wheeled vehicles but the C.T. is is flat out dangerous to others. This thing is worse because it literally has no front bumper. I don't see how it even passed safety standards. Or where they made to go away to please E.M.",

Then this new car comes out, especially as cars in the 90s had gone through the 'melted cheese' design era of soft curves, and sloping shoulder lines. The New Beetle was round, but it was geometric. It was upright and tall for a small car, headroom like this was unheard of in a compact. Once they hit mass production, they were just another car on the road, but seeing them at first release was a cool sight, kind of like the Cybertruck now.",

        "review": "Weather or not a truck is any good depends on how you intend to use it. To me, it's just another tool. I want the most practical truck for my construction business. I don't give a damn about how it looks. Definitely not a fan of Tesla's sloped bed sides - would make putting anything over the side or getting something out of the front of the bed an extreme annoyance and would really piss me off.  If I can't put a 4 x 8 sheet of plywood on the floor of the bed and close the tailgate - useless for my purposes. I punctured a gas tank on a F150 on a rough site - the replacement was about $1,935. To replace the Tesla battery back itself with all modules in it would be around $16,000.  A windshield for a Ford F150 will cost about $700. while the Cybertruck retails for $1,900.  I know it's because of the electronics in the Tesla glass but how do those electronics help my carpenters put more money in my pocket? Now we also have to factor in insurance costs. Insurance companies are steadily raising their rate for EV's because of the ridiculous repair costs. Let's face it, the Tesla truck doesn't seem like it's going to be a long term player in the construction business. More like a novelty item for those that would use it for anything other than your run of the mill pickup.",

When the Beetle was re-leased as the new Beetle, at first we got so many people stopping to stare at us and wave to us, it was hilarious but over time it wore off and now you see very few on the road. And I can say the same for the Mini Cooper. Now both of these are older vehicles that have been re-envisioned and yet they were iconic and people were excited to see them, so not brand new like the CyberTruck, but still will be the same feeling over time.",

        "review": "As a full-size truck owner for the majority of my life, I can honestly say people buy big trucks for one overwhelmingly simple reason:  They're comfortable.  They're not some tiny thing with a harsh, uncomfortable ride, a cramped, claustrophobic interior, little to no headroom, and only space enough for a lunch box or two in the trunk.  Full-size trucks have a very smooth ride, they're quiet, there's plenty of room for everyone to be comfortable, and if/when you need to haul or tow something, you've got that covered.  They're also extremely heavily built and thus pretty safe for those traveling within.  They've also come a long way in terms of design and environmental creature comforts.  They're just better in every way than they used to be 20-30 years ago.  They're also extremely reliable and will last a very, very long time. \n\nSo, yeah, you can get a Raptor or a TRX if you've got the cash, and they're very capable of doing amazing things off road, but they probably never will.  They just look amazing, so people want them, and that's fine.  You don't have to need to haul or tow something in order to justify owning a truck that can do those things.  If you want a vehicle that's safe, comfortable (even luxurious in some trims), and more capable than most things on the road, you buy a full-size truck.  \n\nThe Tesla Model X has been gliding silently through my dreams for years now, and I would dearly love to have one.  The Cybertruck?  I actually like the design, but I don't like that they shrank it so much from the prototype.  I'm sure that won't change, but it'll be interesting to see what does change in the future as these things continue to be mass produced and evolve.",

So ordering a new set for thicker sheet metal was more or less a matter of placing an order.\n\n2) the adaptive steering is also possible the same way with traditional steering racks. Making it drive by wire has other benefits - and drawbacks.\nTesla chose this configuration, because they had to save weight and keep within a reasonable turning circle.\nMy Touareg has adaptive steering and all wheel steering, which results in a turning circle of a VW Golf.",

And yes, that's GPS, so it says 265 kph on the speedo.\nAnd also the cyclist - I completely get it. A car crash with a cybertruck will most probably kill the cyclist.\n\nAnd to your reference to the Countach - it looks amazing, it drives horribly. And the Veyron actually has at least 900 produced, probably a few more. You will probably find 100 already in Monaco, another 100 in Dubai and at least a dozen in Hong Kong.",

To say that it doesnt matter that this truck is bad at truck stuff; towing, range, offroading, because most customers never do that stuff is a bit silly imo, especially when tesla continues to claim class-leading competency in these areas. \nMost customers of the 911 will not track it or command its full potential, but they buy 911s because they are nonetheless best at sports car stuff and you would not reccommend that I buy a golf GTI instead because I'm 'not gonna use that stuff anyway'",

        "review": "Back in the 70s and 80s a major criticism of North American cars was the over focus on style, while ignoring how a vehicle did its job.\n\nSo cars were larger than they needed to be in order to accomplish their purpose. Thus the move from 70s boats to smaller 80s cars with similar interior space,  better build quality, and higher efficiency.\n\nBasically, what I'm saying is that the Cybertruck is the equivalent of a 1976 Cadillac convertible with horns on the hood (check out Boss Hogg's Cadillac in The Dukes of Hazzard).\n\nIt's all about style, with no attention paid to functionality. It's a joke. \n\nBy contrast, the typical truck is a testament to form following function.\n\nAnd the whole acceleration thing is massively overblown. While every car guy/girl loves speed and power, you're talking about performance you can't use, but which will drain the battery even faster.\n\nWhich brings me to the question of environmental concerns.\n\nHow is a truck that is grossly overweight, has limited cargo space and capacity relative to similarly sized real trucks, and is shaped like a building in any way environmentally responsible?\n\nIt's laughable.\n\nIs it a technical tour de force? Yes. But anyone trying to argue that there's any rational basis for buying this thing is kidding themselves. It's the equivalent of saying a Mustang is a legitimate family car because it has vestigial rear seats.\n\nThe Cybertruck is a \"pickup\", but only in the loosest sense.",

        "review": "That was an interesting chart (How F150 owners use their truck).  Here's one other consideration, when you need to tow something substantial, you REALLY need a truck.  You can't rent a truck unless you sign an agreement that you won't tow anything.  So while only 7% of F-150 owners use their truck for towing, there is no other option.  As far as personal hauling, it's the same thing.  Making renovations to your house?  You need something that can haul a 4' x 8' sheet of plywood, drywall, etc.. I did that with a 20 year old Honda Pilot, a full size SUV, but most SUVs now are too small.\nSo for occasional use the Cybertruck that rides like a nice car is cheaper on fuel than any ICE, roomier than most vehicles and will eventually be reasonably priced, why would you want anything else?  \nHere's why not!  It doesn't have that much range.  If Tesla would have kept their promise of close to 500 miles of range then you would get 200 miles of range while towing in the winter, (loose 50% for towing 10,000 lb holiday trailer and another 10% for winter driving).\nIf they can get the Tesla Semi to have 500 miles of range with a GVW or 80,000 lbs, they could have done it with a CT and a GVW or 30,000 lbs.",

However, they don't loudly scream out the owner's personality like the Cybertruck or any version of the Hummer, EV or ICE. Those are loud statement of identity vehicles.

        "review": "You will *not* be fine if you're hit, either by or in this vehicle. Bulletproof stainless steel? There's a reason cars stopped being made of stainless steel a long time ago, and that's cuz during a crash the force and energy will be transferred to the most fragile things first. When you have a rigid car, the thing that'll crumple first is the soft squishy human body. That's why the hood and trunk of a car is made of aluminum. So that in the event of a crash it'll absorb the impact first instead of the human body. The actual cage of a car is usually steel so that you aren't squished to death, but that also means that T-bones are the most dangerous type of crashes because there's no crumple zone to absorb the impact when you're hit.\n\nOf course, this does come with a downside. You get into a minor crash nowadays, and your car's almost guaranteed to be totaled. But that's also the point. You want the car to crumple around the humans as much as possible so the human doesn't die. It's like that one high school project some kids do where you have to drop an egg in a basket from a roof without having the egg crack by wrapping it in soft stuff like toilet paper. You know what'll happen if you put the egg in a stainless steel bottle then drop it from the roof? That egg's exploding. \n\n\nWhen cars were made of steel accidents at what would be considered low speeds today were still dangerous af. Nowadays you get into an accident at 60 MPH and unless you're unlucky or T-boned people are usually not too badly injured. This monstrosity? Bro hitting a wall at 30MPH will be the equivalent of you sprinting faster than Usain Bolt straight into a wall. Not scary with a normal car, potentially fucking fatal with this shit.",

An interesting one to me is my father's Ram 1500 had an issue where the steering column \"wasn't plugged in fully\" and when it became unplugged (which happened multiple times and one was with a Ram mechanic in the vehicle) the whole truck shut down and he couldn't steer it. He's not wimpy and both of us have dealt with \"heavy truck with no power steering\" and the steering didn't lock up, the steering wheel moved... but the wheels did not. It was described to us as being steering by wire, but I see no sign of that on the internet. So either Ram lied to my father or the Cybertruck isn't actually the first drive by wire vehicle (and I'm not saying the Ram is either). That's my only monologue on the topic.\n\nEverything else mentioned is on point.",

Steer-by-wire, 800V architecture or clever air-suspension aren\u2019t this car\u2019s selling point(s). The design, on the other hand, is. So, even though this car definitely received everyone\u2019s attention within the tech/ car enthusiasts community, it will most likely end up being bought by people who want it for its design only and don\u2019t care about the \u201ctruck-stuff\u201d, let alone the technical specs of it. And I guess that\u2019s perfectly legit.",

        "review": "I really hope this style of car building will never really catch on. Let's be honest it looks aweful. It is iconic due to it being so apparently ugly and so it stands out. \n\nIn my eyes the attraction of road users isn't it's most dangerous part. Obviously the suv type cars are all more dangerous than regular road vehicles. \n\nIt sits too high, gives false illusions of control. Weighs too much. What will happen if it rolls? Do the sharp pointy edges of the car hold up? Or do they simply crush under the weight of the entire battery and suspension system? And to get inside the car quickly in the event of an emergency, you have to wait an extra second to get into the car as it has no physical handles... A handle will always be faster. Nice having a bullet proof car. But when you are getting shot at, that extra second to get into the bulletproof, metal thing, will add up... \n\nIt is a mixed bag. The designers put totally random american stereotypes on the table and said 'let's do it all in one car'. \n\nThen the manipulative and failure of marketing it in any factual or practical way hits the final nail in the coffin. See it as a delorean. Except the cybertruck doesn't have any real character. At least the delorean looked sharp, and was put together with lots of passion. They simply neede way more money. \n\nThe cybertruck designers had all the money they wanted. Tesla doesn't need to target their audience. Their audience targets them. And then they come with such mixed piece of metal angled, so called 'simplicity' or 'minimalism'. Yet not having a problem with making their services overly complex. Hooking you up with all the usual tesla subscriptions to keep your seats heated. In a matter of speaking... \n\nTesla has never really gotten close to the other older, minimalistic cars out there. I haven't seen a Tesla with soul or character. It's all hightech and standing out. That is in no way at all what makes a ferrari or mclaren the beauties they are. It's a hype. Nothing more. And in 30 years we will look back at it and maybe see why it was modest. But nobody will ever understand why it had to be made in the first place. As it has no purpose at all.\n\nThat is what it's lacking. Without purpose you lose all forms of character.",

Of course most of that can, in most cases, also be controlled thru the touch screen or like on my Tesla via stalks.   Also the left scroll wheel allows changing the driver display on my MS to one of a few on the right or left side of the display. Just some examples.  Btw, every 4-5 weeks there is a free OTA software update that keeps making the car more functional and/or sometimes more fun/cool if it's only a cosmetic thing, so the Tesla gets better as time passes.

Both could've rode right by without externalising their opinion of it, but one chose to express positivity and the other negativity. Pretty much sums it up. The closed minded and most obnoxious of society hate this vehicle, and the rest of us who don't have the time or inclination to hate an inatimate object because it's different (or because of who made it) seem to either love it or at least enjoy a fleeting moment of amusement at something new and creative. Online it's overwhelmingly snide comments and negativity, outside in the real world it's overwhelmingly people pulling out their cameras and fawning over it.",
