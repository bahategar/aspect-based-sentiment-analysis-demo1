They did not make the seals to the power points well enough to keep water out so they made that mode to close those parts and protect the car. But if you have adhd like me or just having a stressful/busy day, you will forget and brick your 'truck'. Not to mention I've seen posts about this happening and it will void the warranty so you're screwed. \n3 You did mention that the windows are stronger than normal but, specifically they are meant to be shatterproof. Sure this is great if you live in a high crime area but, what would happen if you went off a bridge? I can't say ive seen one submerged so i don't know exactly how it would go, but normal procedure is, unbuckle, grab something for breaking the window and bust out the back windshield. How are you going to do that with this? \n4 You didn't mention a common problem with Tesla cars in general, that the doors are completely powered by the battery. ( Some may be different, i don't know ) And there are many reports of their battery dying for one reason or not, and becoming unable to get in or out of the car. If this 'truck' were to have this problem, how would you get out/back in? You can't get out the windows thats for sure, and tow companys are going to have a hell of a time getting it to a shop of its stuck in park.\nI can understand if maybe you didn't want to include these because they specifically weren't your experience, but they should atleast have a footnote in the video instead of completely ignored.

The stainless steel panels rust very easily (anything from dead bugs to bird droppings can lead to rusting) and the panels will start to change colour if exposed to water whilst in the sun (something like the second CT at 26:01).\n2. To avoid the rusting problem Tesla charges 5k to put a protective coating on the panels which they should have put on it in the first place\n3. The panels are not fucking bulletproof\n4. Drag racing it is pretty dumb if you are not going to be towing stuff either. One could argue that the people who buy the CT are more likely to tow something than ever be in any form of race with it.\n5. For a truck it has a very tiny bay, no bigger than the average Suzuki light truck, this is a very important bit of information considering how that bay size dictates how much you can potentially carry. You didn't at all dwell on this part and only briefly touched on it by saying you and your crew use it to move your equipment but exactly how much equipment was that bro? Surely you caould have taken 2 or 3 minutes to just show how many grocery bags or suitcases can fit in the bay and taken 2 or 3 less minutes glazing the \"iconic design\" \n6.

Those qualities will prevail so as production ramps up and wont be unique anymore price will plummet no doubt. I would think second hand owner market is much more sensible and chooses based on those qualities not some temporal celebrity fad. This car will age terribly, and maintenance will be very costly. Its like owning used Range Rover - you know itll break, you know itll be costly but at least you get luxury. Cybertruck? Dont think so."

It's like a 2006 Honda Ridgeline drawn by a 4 year old made by a company whose grifter CEO acts like a 5 year old. Tesla was already the epitome of 'Form over Function' due to prioritizing aesthetics and high profit margins (for example, by removing radar and ultrasonic sensors for cheaper optical cameras), but this model takes that to a new low by having a hideous form. I've seen several in person (both standard and ones with wraps), and they're hideous and ridiculous. The production quality is predictably horrible (the production issues as addressed in the video are inexcusable for such a tiny run of *luxury* vehicles), repairs are absurdly expensive, and the brake lights don't work properly. The actual utility of it (as mentioned in the video) is laughable because it has low towing power,  you can't fit much in the truck bed, it has difficulty going up inclines that over vehicles climb with ease, the range is significantly less than advertised, the battery compartment is only half full, and it needs to be cleaned off shortly after getting wet. Tesla even says you shouldn't take it through a car wash! It's not bulletproof except against a small percentage of handguns, and the height and design of the vehicle makes it difficult to see pedestrians in front of you. Yoke steering wheels are also a known safety hazard. But hey, you do you I guess.\n\nAnother fun fact is that working at Tesla is dangerous because the company is infamous for ignoring safety best practices in their factories because Musk hates the color yellow, doesn't like safety signs, and doesn't like beeping noises. Not sure why he even cares what the factories look like, since he's not an engineer, he apparently doesn't care about the condition Tesla vehicles leave the factories in, and he's on Twitter all the time anyway.",

The social networks made the sharing of ideas available for absolutely every person in the world. The inventions became just trends, the misteries became debunked in the comments, the heroes became influencers in order to monetize their status. And that is fine - just this is the product of the reality, that we live in. If there was Instagram during the Trojan War, Achilles would be a viral star and he will leave Hector alive, so can make a podcast with him later on youtube. Last week I was exploring Milano. During one of the evenings I was waiting the metro to arrive and there were multiple screens on the walls of the station. They were showing the Pope reading statesments about the situation in Israel. And on the bottom there was a banner with a brief information. On the left it was written \"PAPA\", which is Pope in italian. But not \"the Pope\" (Il Papa), not Pope Francis, but just \"PAPA\". There were around 50 people around. May be I was the only one who was watching the broadcast with the Pope. Nobody was interested at all and this is in Italy. Can you imagine in 15 or 16th Century, what it would be to see and listen to the pope. One of a kind experience in your life, almost like a devine moment. Now some influencers who give money if you are the last one leaving a red circle on the ground, are more important for the people than the pope. But here is the difference. Nobody is interested in Mr Beast as a human, or even as a YouTube genius. 99% are interested in his money and his exposure. You need him either to earn easy money, or to receive gigantic advertising, hence again earn a lot of money. When the legend has a price it turns to a bestseller. Mr Beast is not and he will never be an icon. The CyberTruck is not and it will never be an icon. Not in the Today's world. It is impossible. The money are the God of Internet and \"in GOD we TRUST\" (TRUST not Believe). The Saint halo is a \"Verified\" badge. That is what you need to see in order to be sure that this is the real \"devine\" person. There is this show on NG \"The best of the decades\"... and they show the icons of each DECADE. Icon for a decade? Some of the saints are icons for 2000 years.  This is what happens when you bind the virtues with money. The future of the human kind doesn't rely on how popular we are, it relies on how sustainable we are as a society. The real science knowledge, the real art and the real life virtues brought us to the 21st Century. Only if you are considered a true genius in those 3 life aspects, you can become a true icon. The Cybertruck will be just a cool truck with a cool story in 10 years, but Elon Musk will be considered as a genius even after 100 years. Elon is the Icon, not the Cybertruck. Nobody remembers who was a millionaire in Salzburg in the times of Mozart, but Mozart is still considered one of the greatest geniuses of the Music for all times. Nobody speaks about the wealthy nobles who ordered Da Vinci to paint for them. But Da Vinci is still considered as a science and an art genius for almost 500 years already. And that is their purpose - to give the human kind a good future, or we will extinct. The human kind exists for around a million years, and our modern world and society exists only for two Centuries. We are frighteningly close to reverse the process. The idea to make the people good hearted and educated, the society to be sustainable, is what keeps the ICONS alive. Everything other lives shortly and will be forgotten.",

There are mutterings that the company may go bankrupt.\n\nIt happened that his review was reechoed by the users of the car with less platform.\n\nAnd where is MKBHD today, surprisingly, he is still a free man with the right to call any product crap with his reasons in so far as he bought it and is sharing his honest perspective as a user.\n\nNigerians are struggling to relate to this because if MKBHD was in Nigeria, he will be arrested first and fellow citizens will defend it because MKBHD does not know what it takes to build a business.\n\n*********************\nNote: The car company lied about some features that are not there. An integrity issue. They also sold a product that was not ready not minding the risks this poses for their customers. Nigerians want to wait until people died before they do Quality Assurance.\n\nGot this from Ayo Ademokoya's wall.",

Ironically I would bet that it will eventually end up in a Chinese metal and electronics recycling facility. Industrial dishwashers are made from higher grade stainless steel than the body of that truck. Anyone with knowledge of metal compositions can tell you that stainless steel has several grades and anything other than 316 grade stainless steel which is the highest grade, 316 grade stainless steel is actually mandatory grade for work surfaces that must be used for any commercial or industrial kitchens in many regions, since it doesn't corrode or rust so it can be used for food prep and not become rusty when exposed to salt and water which are the most common kitchen ingredients but also what will make exposed steel or cheap stainless steel to rust. The cybertruck body is made from 300 grade stainless, which will definitely rust when driven in the rust belt during the winter, especially if taken on salted highways in the winter. The choice to use 300 grade stainless maybe because of cost or weight, but the same process is used to fabricate and cut panels to shape 300 grade stainless and it wouldnt be any more difficult to create the body from 316 stainless steel which is actually rust resistant, also easier to clean, and 300 grade stainless is only slightly more durable than just a standard sheet metal. I have a garbage can thats made of higher grade stainless steel than the Cybertruck.",

Anyone with knowledge of metal compositions can tell you that stainless steel has several grades and anything other than 316 grade stainless steel which is the highest grade, 316 grade stainless steel is actually mandatory grade for work surfaces that must be used for any commercial or industrial kitchens in many regions, since it doesn't corrode or rust so it can be used for food prep and not become rusty when exposed to salt and water which are the most common kitchen ingredients but also what will make exposed steel or cheap stainless steel to rust. The cybertruck body is made from 300 grade stainless, which will definitely rust when driven in the rust belt during the winter, especially if taken on salted highways in the winter. The choice to use 300 grade stainless maybe because of cost or weight, but the same process is used to fabricate and cut panels to shape 300 grade stainless and it wouldnt be any more difficult to create the body from 316 stainless steel which is actually rust resistant, also easier to clean, and 300 grade stainless is only slightly more durable than just a standard sheet metal. I have a garbage can thats made of higher grade stainless steel than the Cybertruck."

I know it's because of the electronics in the Tesla glass but how do those electronics help my carpenters put more money in my pocket? Now we also have to factor in insurance costs. Insurance companies are steadily raising their rate for EV's because of the ridiculous repair costs.

They're not some tiny thing with a harsh, uncomfortable ride, a cramped, claustrophobic interior, little to no headroom, and only space enough for a lunch box or two in the trunk.  Full-size trucks have a very smooth ride, they're quiet, there's plenty of room for everyone to be comfortable, and if/when you need to haul or tow something, you've got that covered.  They're also extremely heavily built and thus pretty safe for those traveling within.  They've also come a long way in terms of design and environmental creature comforts.  They're just better in every way than they used to be 20-30 years ago.  They're also extremely reliable and will last a very, very long time. \n\nSo, yeah, you can get a Raptor or a TRX if you've got the cash, and they're very capable of doing amazing things off road, but they probably never will.  They just look amazing, so people want them, and that's fine.  You don't have to need to haul or tow something in order to justify owning a truck that can do those things.  If you want a vehicle that's safe, comfortable (even luxurious in some trims), and more capable than most things on the road, you buy a full-size truck.  \n\nThe Tesla Model X has been gliding silently through my dreams for years now, and I would dearly love to have one.  The Cybertruck?  I actually like the design, but I don't like that they shrank it so much from the prototype.  I'm sure that won't change, but it'll be interesting to see what does change in the future as these things continue to be mass produced and evolve.",

There's a reason cars stopped being made of stainless steel a long time ago, and that's cuz during a crash the force and energy will be transferred to the most fragile things first. When you have a rigid car, the thing that'll crumple first is the soft squishy human body. That's why the hood and trunk of a car is made of aluminum. So that in the event of a crash it'll absorb the impact first instead of the human body. The actual cage of a car is usually steel so that you aren't squished to death, but that also means that T-bones are the most dangerous type of crashes because there's no crumple zone to absorb the impact when you're hit.\n\nOf course, this does come with a downside. You get into a minor crash nowadays, and your car's almost guaranteed to be totaled. But that's also the point. You want the car to crumple around the humans as much as possible so the human doesn't die. It's like that one high school project some kids do where you have to drop an egg in a basket from a roof without having the egg crack by wrapping it in soft stuff like toilet paper. You know what'll happen if you put the egg in a stainless steel bottle then drop it from the roof? That egg's exploding. \n\n\nWhen cars were made of steel accidents at what would be considered low speeds today were still dangerous af. Nowadays you get into an accident at 60 MPH and unless you're unlucky or T-boned people are usually not too badly injured. This monstrosity? Bro hitting a wall at 30MPH will be the equivalent of you sprinting faster than Usain Bolt straight into a wall. Not scary with a normal car, potentially fucking fatal with this shit.",

I was thinking if there are millions of videos on this and I have watched every single one of them what different is this video going to do? But yet again marques pulls up something interesting that you eagerly feel like watching. Great stuff, great way to go about a topic which is already juiced out to its limits.",
