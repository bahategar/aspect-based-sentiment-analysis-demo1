37,B074P62MW8,Michael Mcfadden,5,"September 26, 2017",True,Sony Returns to Form,"With the XZ1, Sony's Xperia line returns to form. After wandering in the cel phone wilderness for the last year or so, the electronics giant pulled their collective heads out of their collective hindquarters and have delivered a very good (if not quite great) flagship mobile device. The past 12-16 months gave us the X, the X Compact, the X Performance, the XZ, the XZS, the XA1, and a gaggle of other mid-tier offerings from Sony. Of them, only the XZS and the XZ Premium could come close to laying claim to flagship status, with the latter coming with one of the finest 4K displays in the business. Unfortunately XZS didn't come with a battery big enough to power the nice phone specs, and the XZ Premium was an exceptionally large phone, at an exceptionally large price. The XZ1 sees the company step up it's game. As of this writing, it's one of the few devices shipping with Android 8 / Oreo out of the box, running the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, with a beautiful 1080 display and a slightly-refined physical design and sturdy-feeling build-quality. And for nearly $700, it certainly should have a premium feel to it. Even the best phones are balancing acts of compromise, so while there's certainly something here for everyone, it's also unlikely to appeal to absolutely everyone. Most people either love or hate Sony's take on industrial design. Some bemoan the size of the top and bottom bezels. In a world where the S8 strives to give customers nothing-but-screen, Sony certainly isn't following the fashion train. But they sure as heck are following the functional-device-train. Having owned an S8, I certainly see the appeal. It's a beautiful looking device. But at the end of the day, I found the lack of bezels to be a problem in day to day use. With no edge on which to rest fingertips, I was constantly accidentally activating various apps, or accidentally hitting the wrong onscreen area within a given app. Nice to look at...but darn if it's not a pain to actually use. So, here's a subjective run down of Pros and Cons: PRO - Great screen. In addition to it's Triluminous setting, Sony has added a new video color-saturating setting. Honestly, it looks like they're taking a stab at the popping colors and deep blacks on OLED devices like the S8. And they've done a good job...this is one of the sharpest, most color popping screens out there at the moment. - Great processor. The new Snapdragon is great. Everything runs smoothly. - Headphone jack / Audio processing. Yay for hanging on to this bit of tech, the old headphone jack. Bluetooth headphones are well and good, but they eat up a battery, and they can't deliver the same quality of audio as a wired set. If how your music sounds on your device is important to you, wired is still the way to go. For now at least. And Sony's DESS audio processing sounds pretty great to my ears. Pick up a third party audio player like Neutron if you'd like even more control of the sound. CON - Physical design. This really doesn't belong in the ""con"" column, but the fact is either you like what Sony is doing here, or you don't. - Price. Sony offers a handful of budget models, but their flagship line has never been anything but pricey. Especially in America where the brand isn't known for it's mobile devices, the average android user might be hard pressed to pay $699 to a company they normally associate with televisions. In Europe and Asia, though, Sony remains a popular contender with Samsung and Apple for high end devices. - Battery. This also might not be a negative, as the new Snapdragon and Oreo are alleged to be more efficient with their power use. Running some benchmarks seem to bear this out, as while it leads in most areas, there are some processes they've scaled back. So far, I don't see any penalty in processing power, but I've also not had it long enough to take a firm stance on battery life.

The recent update killed the ease of use and coverting text from handwriting to text. So I do not use it anymore. 3. Fast response. Have had this phone for about 9 months. Still just as fast responding to touch and opening apps as day one. 4. Can only be used with a max mini SD card of 64gb. This is a minor complaint only. 5. Does not get hot. Unless you are doing a lot of stuff while charging this device does not get hot to the touch. The normal running temp is about 100 degrees Fahrenheit but you can not feel it. 6. Charges fast from dead to full charge. This is based on stock charger that comes with phone which pushes 2.1 amps. I also use a 3.5 amp car charger which it charges faster with. 7. The IR ability I use a lot for controlling my TV and dvr. The app the phone comes with is the best app but the app does need improvement though this is not the phones fault. 8. WiFi is fast. My Internet speed tops at 40mb/s and the phone WiFi can do it. Unlike most phones WiFi usually cap at 20mb/s no matter what. 9. I have the Verizon 4G lte and the lte I have seen push 60mb/s for speeds so again the phone ability for strong and fast signal is impressive. A bunch of other things positive and negative.

61,B00V7FY44A,D. Matheny,5,"April 10, 2015",False,Best Smartphone I've Ever Owned,"I originally picked up this Galaxy S6 Edge because of the unique look; but, the more I use it, the more I like it! I've been using Samsung Galaxy phones for several years now; but, I was seriously considering moving on to a competitor until I saw the new S6 Edge. Let me say that this phone not only looks great - it backs up the looks with a fantastic phone! [*** Curved Edge ***] The S6 is an awesome phone, but is the curved edge worth the extra cost? Personally, I see 4 advantages to the curved edge: 1) It looks cool! If you're looking for a unique phone, then this is one of the most unique designs on the market. 2) The alarm clock feature is awesome! I've been using my phone as an alarm clock (like most people), but I've also missed being able to glance over to see the time. (I mean, who doesn't want to confirm that they still have 5 more hours of sleep?) If you consider that a docking alarm clock can easily cost $100 - then this phone starts to seem like a better deal. 3) Without a case, this phone is a little awkward to pick up off a table; but, with a case it's actually easier to hold and handle. This is definitely something I wasn't expecting. 4) The phone feels extremely thin with the curved edge! As a result, it fits great in my pocket and is easy to hold. There are some other features that the curved edge offers (like the colored contact notifications) - but I haven't found them to be overly useful. On top of that, it does tend to be more reflective outside since there are 3 angles catching the sun. I'm glad I went with the Edge, but I can see how that could be a pro or a con depending on who is looking at it. >>> [*** Update 4/19/2015 ***] <<< Finding a screen protector for the Edge turned out to be a bit harder than I expected - and I finally got sick of the one that I initially got with the phone and tried some others. Anyway, if you are looking for a good screen protector, I would highly recommend trying the IQ Shield LiQuidSkin protector. It does a great job of protecting the screen without interfering with the curved edge. [*** Wireless Charging ***] Even with my S5, I used a Qi Receiver Card - and I have to admit that wireless charging is extremely convenient. Fortunately, the S6 has wireless charging built in - and I definitely recommend giving it a try if you get this phone! The main things to keep in mind with wireless charging are: 1) Thick cases do negatively impact wireless charging - so I'd recommend a case that isn't overly bulky. (There are lots of protective cases for the S6 edge that aren't bulky: like the Spigen Neo Hybrid case.) 2) Even though wireless charging is extremely convenient, it's definitely slower than wired charging - so it's not great for a quick charge if you're nearing empty. Personally, I keep a wireless charging pad on my desk at work and by my nightstand. I can just drop the S6 on the charger whenever it looks like the phone is going to start running low. The wireless charging on this phone is more sensitive, and works far better, than using a Qi adapter with the S5 phone. [*** Wired Charging ***] Although I prefer wireless charging, the wired charging performance of the S6 Edge is amazing! When you use wired charging devices, be sure to verify that they're compatible with the Quick Charge 2.0 standard. With my Quick Charge Car Charger, I can get from empty to half full in a matter of minutes! [*** Non-Removable Battery ***] This phone does NOT have a removable battery, so battery life is more important than ever. So far, the S6 Edge seems to have pretty comparable battery life to my previous Galaxy S5 - although I have't done any scientific testing. When combined with the convenience of wireless charging, the battery life isn't an issue at all for me. Having said that, the bigger issue is that I can't easily replace the battery if it dies. Last year, both my phone and my wife's required a battery replacement; and, although it's possible with the S6 Edge, it's definitely not as easy - and I suspect it would be close to the hassle of a screen replacement... Even with that downside, I do love the thinner profile of the S6 Edge - and the non-removable battery is a big part of what makes that possible. [*** No SD Card Support ***] In my opinion, this has been the biggest problem with the S6 Edge! I don't have a ton of music; but, it's just enough that an external Micro SD card really helps. At this point, I've come up with a couple of alternate solutions for music: 1) So far, using the Beat Music app with Cloud storage seems to be the best option. It's pretty easy to setup, and my music is easily available when I want to listen. I can also setup a configurable amount of caching locally so files don't always need to be streamed. 2) Since I pretty much only listen to music at work, I ordered an OTG USB Flash Drive, and I'll see how that works once I get it. At the end of the day, the lack of removable SD card support is more an issue of getting used to it than anything else - at least that's how I'm trying to look at it... >>> [*** Update 4/12/2015 ***] <<< After playing around with different ways to store my music and files, I've settled on using the Google Play Music service. It was easy to copy my existing music files into it - and the service is free. It player also works at least as well as the player I'm used to using. As far as the OTG Flash Drive goes, it works well - but isn't as convenient as I'd hoped since I have to remove the phone case to get it to work. It will be a good option for backing up or transferring files - but not for every-day usage. [*** Case Compatibility ***] The S6 Edge has tons of case options - and I've actually tried quite a few of them already. Personally, I'm currently leaning toward the Spigen Neo Hybrid case - but I'll give that a few more days before deciding for sure. [*** Screen Resolution ***] This screen is sharp! I know most phones in this class have sharp screens these days - but I think this is the absolute best screen on the market right now. The higher resolution impacts lots of little things you may not expect. For example, this phone can show more notification icons simultaneously on the top notification panel than my S5 - and they look clearer. [*** Performance ***] The performance of this phone is excellent! The combination of the S6 hardware and Android 5.0 seems to be a potent combination, and I'm extremely impressed with it. (Actually, Android 5.0 on it's own is a pretty good upgrade.) [*** Build Quality ***] Although I know, logically, that the glass back is probably more fragile than it seems - it makes the phone feel like a top-of-the-line piece of hardware. This thing absolutely screams quality. It looks and feels like a work of art. [*** Conclusion ***] I think Samsung made a great move by improving the feel and looks of the S6 phones. On top of that, offering it in both standard and Edge variants was also a great move since the Edge won't appeal to everyone. If you're on the fence between the models, then the standard phone is probably the way to go - but if the Edge is calling your name, I would definitely recommend giving it a try!",63.0,"look, music app, receiver card, otg flash, battery replacement, high resolution, phone fragile, quality, move, music, advantage, comparable battery, service, glass, con, try, little thing, name, more hour, use, non-removable battery, micro sd, external micro, phone start, cloud storage, exist music, angle catch, device, card enough, best smartphone, screen replacement, color contact, day usage, play music, resolution impact, case compatibility, car charger, different way, other feature, protective case, phone feel, run, s6 phone, removable sd, big problem, screen resolution, line piece, best option, ton, big issue, thinner profile, curve edge, unique look, curved edge, charge car, good option, case option, more day, good upgrade, standard, good deal, big part, scientific testing, usb flash, thespigen neo, s6 hardware, great move, top notification, phone case, edge worth, alternate solution, shield liquidskinprotector, android, wireless charge, wife, contact notification, card support, notification icon, potent combination, file, awesome phone, phone, galaxy s6, extra cost, galaxy phone, time, get use, wire charging, sharp screen, neo hybrid, most people, edge, wired charge, sd card, alarm clock, more notification, standard phone, music file, good screen, hybrid case, previous galaxy, unique design, battery life, edge great, notification panel, last year, wireless charging, edge variant, music service, several year, new s6, class, best screen, aqi receiver, removable battery, quick charge, myquick charge, battery, beat music, clock feature, thick case, great job, docking alarm, configurable amount, google play, impact lot, s6 edge, screen protector, feel, wire charge, others, anotg usb, galaxy s5, edge offer, screen, s5 phone, charge performance, theiq shield, main thing, fantastic phone, performance, qi adapter, thing, charge pad, flash drive, unique phone, try theiq",Summary error,"- Best Smartphone I have Ever Owned.

Android users can't go wrong with this.","Well, since I'm far from the first review of this phone I won't go into all the features (which I've only scratched the surface of anyway!). Instead I'll just give my overall impressions. I LOVE this phone. It looks great, fantastic screen and size, it's thin and light. The speed is excellent on just about every app and feature I've used. I really have no complaints after about 2 weeks of using it. Oh, battery life ... having had the S2 before this with battery life of - maybe - half a day this is a pleasure. For example, as I write this at about 11pm after an admittedly light usage day, the battery is still at 74% I'm not saying this is the norm but so far I have not had a day where the phone would have died before the end of the day if I hadn't charged it. We'll see how that holds up over time but for now, battery life is excellent. BATTERY UPDATE: Have had the phone close to 2 weeks now and I must say that battery life has been more than acceptable. Today is a fairly typical day I think. As I write this around 3:30pm I'm at close to 70% battery life. Considering that it was fully charged at 6:30am I'd say that's not too bad. Hope this is helpful. Oh, and as a kicker, I managed to snag this for $0.01 thanks to an unannounced (as far as I know) Amazon sale so that makes this phone even sweeter.

I have an iPhone 4 through work and personally has a Samsung S3 ... I hated that phone!! On more than one occasion, I was tempted to take a hammer to it! Siri on the iPhone was SO superior when doing a search, getting directions and more. Some times the S3 couldn't even find an often called name in my phone directory. So that's where I was headed, when after some research I came across a review of the S6 Edge by an Apple devotee and iPhone lover. He was blown away by the Edge. This phone is nothing like its predecessors. It is intuitive, Getting directions happens in split seconds and in fact faster and more accurate than the navigation system in my car. This phone is sleek (slippery in hand too!) This is a very robust OS on the phone, so be prepared to speend some time learning all of the enhancements and features you aren't accustomed to. At my workplace, we all have iPhone company phones. The VP came back from a family trip in Europe, where his daughter met up with them and had her new S6 Edge. He was blown away, especially with the picture quality. And pictures and video quality is outstanding!

As previously mentioned, this phone is so smmoth, it's actually a little slippery to handle, so be sure to get the Speigen cover ( I think it was the Ultra Hybrid). And if you get the gold platinum like I did, get the clear Speigen cover as it takes nothing away from the beauty of the phone.
