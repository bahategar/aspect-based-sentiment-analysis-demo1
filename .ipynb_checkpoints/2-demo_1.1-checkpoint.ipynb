He said $1 ohhhh i snapped lol so the deal is you get to pay a extra $1 for 2 ? So i just said give me 3 $ hashbrowns. Then they said its tax.. I wanted to jump out of my brand new suv .. Lol i now see why they have those videos of people jumping on fast food workers! So i gave them my card and call the manager and he was just as smart as them. Armando said we do have sandwiches for $3. I almost threw my phone. I said i never asked you about a sandwich i said hashbrowns. Smh then i just said good bye sir you'll be hearing from me again.

I only go here when I see they are not busy, in hope that my order is correct when I go to leave. In the 10 times that I have been here in the past past year, I have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct. Just ONE, not an exaggeration. That one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else. Though I will mention that when I got home and pulled them out of the bag, they were hardly what you'd call filled, (nor did I enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home) so little so that I even sent a picture and post to McDonald's on Facebook, at least the few were hot. The evening staff is very pleasant, but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired, as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which, being a light skinned Puerto Rican, I understand perfectly. I have submitted several complaints and NEVER received a call or email back. I just don't go here anymore to avoid the stress of paying money for something that is most likely wrong.\",\n",

I was happy there was an option for 24-hr food in case I wanted something on the way home from a night out with friends or just late-night munchies.  During the day, it\\'s a pretty average McD\\'s.  But they lost my business forever when I went by one night at 1am, pulled up to the order box, waited for five minutes, then finally someone came over the speaker and said \"Sorry we\\'re closed\".\\n\\nClosed?!  It\\'s 24-hrs!  And I get it, sometimes 24-hr places will close one night every several months to do a deep cleaning.  I get that, I really do.  But they ALWAYS post signs and notices so you\\'re not blind-sided by it.  Not this place.  I really don\\'t think they were closed.  I think the workers were too lazy to do their job and decided to shut the store down so they could get paid to do nothing.\\n\\nAdditionally, this store has a bad habit of having a \"broken\" ice cream machine past 10pm.  It\\'s always \"sorry, ice cream machine is broken\" if you come in after the lobby closes.\\n\\nThe worst part is I complained on the website.  I submitted a complaint for this store, pointing out the 24-hr and the ice cream issue.
