Once I paid and pulled up to the window to pick up, I  was told to pull up to the #1 space. I sat there and sat there and.........25 minutes later, no order. I  went in and no one was at the counter. I yelled \"hello\" three times. A young lady came up asking who was handling the front counter. A young girl appeared. To make this complaint shorter, I  showed my receipt and another 5 minutes later I got my order. There was another order with a drink sitting on the counter that never got to the person who ordered it. After getting home, I  had no regular hamburg but had cookies. Everyone, don't even bother going to this location again. It's a horrible experience every time as you can see by other reviews.",

I told again we are ready. responded after a pause. Again what do you want... excuse me.. who talks to customers like this ??\nI asked for his name to put a review and he flat out denied. I asked for receipt before handing my credit card. He swipes it and returns back my card. I m waiting for a receipt with my family in the car. He starts inputing another order on his tablet. Waited for sometime and then I waive my hand several times. He opens window and said you can get receipt from next window.

Worked in the service industry for years as a server, bartender, and trainer. Taking and fulfilling orders is NOT hard, tedious at times though. I only go here when I see they are not busy, in hope that my order is correct when I go to leave. In the 10 times that I have been here in the past past year, I have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct. Just ONE, not an exaggeration. That one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else. Though I will mention that when I got home and pulled them out of the bag, they were hardly what you'd call filled, (nor did I enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home) so little so that I even sent a picture and post to McDonald's on Facebook, at least the few were hot. The evening staff is very pleasant, but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired, as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which, being a light skinned Puerto Rican, I understand perfectly. I have submitted several complaints and NEVER received a call or email back. I just don't go here anymore to avoid the stress of paying money for something that is most likely wrong.",

        "review": "Normally this location does pretty good, but last night was absolutely ridiculous. I sat in the drive thru for almost an hour waiting to get my order taken, the line was wrapped almost TWICE around the building, and finally I gave up and tried driving up to the window to give them my order since i was next in line. When i got to the window, they told me they couldn't take it and I'd have to go back around. I told them I'd like to put in my order here since I've been waiting all this time, and they proceeded to still refuse and that it's my fault for waiting in the second lane that they claimed was closed and had a sign out. The second lane was open, and the \"sign\" they were talking about was a wet floor sign they had placed right next to the drive-thru menu. I told them the lane looked open from our side and they still proceeded to argue with me, and then slammed the drive thru window shut. I've never received such deplorable customer service in my life, and if any managers are reading this, I highly suggest firing the two workers from last night.",

        "review": "They get an extra Star because their staff 8 of 10 have been polite. Drive through has issues. They constantly get order wrong. Ask you to pull forward to fix and leave you hanging. I have had to go in twice to see why I am still sitting after five minutes. They are new. I understand training new people. But when you place an order and they repeat it back correctly and it comes out wrong or you have to repeat 3 times to make sure they get it right. Someone inside needs to make sure they are reading the whole ticket. Not just a quarter pounder. Especially with the multi menu choice of adding bacon or lettuce and tomatoes. Their tea as of late has tasted like dish soap and their fountain drinks have a funky taste to them. Numerous times their fries have been under cooked.",
