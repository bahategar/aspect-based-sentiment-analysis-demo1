So flattering and so comfortable!,"I am in love with this dress! It has a relaxed fit style as described, and I received compliments from my sister and a stranger when I was doing groceries haha. It has pockets and a zipper on the left side. The fabric is breathable and comfortable. It fits perfectly and has the perfect length. I paired it with beige sandals and a beige crossbody bag for a casual look. For reference I am 5'1 and got a size extra small.

Cute but It Pills,"Great color and pattern, with the on trend “slouchy” look without being too oversized. Material began to pill after first wearing, and became worse after first washing. Did launder inside out in cold on hand wash cycle and line dried.",3.0,Sweaters,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0
It fell apart after one wash,"One set fell apart after one wash. Threads came loose,the ""tie"" had only one string that I can get to.

"Comfortable, nice color, but LOTS of pilling.","I like the fit, weight, and color of this sweater a lot. I would have purchased more colors if the fabric didn’t pull so badly so quickly.

Nice pants horrible zipper,"I bought 6 pair of these when I tore the tendons in my shoulder, because  they were easy to pull on with one arm. I bought size 38, and they fit perfectly.

Positively agree,All the rave reviews are true!  this vest is plush and funky and i love wearing it. i'm having fun figuring out different outfits to wear with this. this is a great three season layering piece and i'm thrilled i was able to get it on sale.  my only regret was the lack of a petite selection.,5.0,Fine gauge,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Lightweight yet rugged,"This shirt is exactly what I needed for outdoor work in the sun.

It shrinks,"Overall for the price it’s a cute sweater. It’s stretchy enough to where you can pull it back to normal but it’s going to be an often occurrence. It’s very soft and actually very comfy to wear.HOWEVER. This thing shrinks like heck in the dryer and it shows in the sleeves (which come up a couple inches). It also shrinks the neckline that will then hug your neck. One size fits all is a mild laugh, if you are any sort of busty then prepare to show that off.

Fits like maternity,"I wanted to love this, was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful, but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top, and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back, in the back, because it does not lay flat like that in front, it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning.",2.0,Blouses,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Disappointing quality,"I was so disappointed with the quality of this dress, especially because it looks so beautiful on the model. the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash, it's already developing a tiny hole and pilling. also, it is definitely not a ""day dress""--i wore it as a swim coverup, but it is much too thin and pajama-like to be worn as an actual dress. the color is much different in person--the blue is brighter and, for lack of a better way to describe it, cheap looking. the white banding around the t",2.0,Lounge,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0

Love this dress!,I bought this dress to wear to a wedding. I was skeptical because I’m short and nothing I buy online ever works. I FREAKING LOVE THIS DRESS! Hugs all the good curves and fits well. 10/10 will wear this beauty again. I’m 5 foot tall and weigh 135 lbs. I purchased a size small. There is a good amount of stretch and it’s super comfortable. The fabric isn’t itchy. The slit is a little high for my comfort level but I’m also rather conservative.

Cute and cozy but poor quality fabric,"This jacket is cozy, warm, and very cute, but after the 1st washing (according to the manufacturer's instructions) it began to pill and has worsened each time.",3.0,Jackets,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
"Cute, with reservations","First one i received was ripping apart already in the sleeve opening at wrist (warning: very tight sleeves!), plus 2"" of the green shiny band detail was missed altogether by whomever sewed this particular one- just left unstitched. and long threads were hanging in several places. this is by no means a quality piece and is severely overpriced. on the positive side, it is very cute and i'm keeping the replacement one, but know that it is also delicate. after one use, there is a snag on the inside",3.0,Lounge,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
