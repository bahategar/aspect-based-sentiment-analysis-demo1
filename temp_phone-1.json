However my seller marked my phone as \"like new\" but the phone has scuffs on the corners (literally all four corners) and a scuff on the lock button that makes it feel gummy (no positive click like the volume buttons) and it has to be pressed hard, sometimes twice. I can live with it but I wish if I paid for like new I got like new.",

The box came with - Galaxy A50 - Case - Sim tool - Quick charge American adapter and cable type c - low quality headphones I have used this phone for a while now and its really almost flagship level. For the price it's perfect. It will work 4g lte GSM for most providers in the States. I'll update if it works on Cricket. Performance great. UI great. Camera great. The security is great as well. But the finger scanner in the screen is not the best but it gets the job done. It looks amazing as well! Overall good phone. Edit: It works perfectly with Cricket with 4g lte.",

That, unfortunately, is where the good ends and the bad begins. I had to return this phone. I have extremely poor reception, which I suspect is a problem with the device I received rather than a problem inherent to the S6. The other issue is that, although the glass had been replaced, it was not seated properly or flush with the edges. I could get my thumb nail underneath the glass and see the dust/lint that had collected inside. Obviously does not have the water-resistant properties that it would have had from the factory. Thank god for amazon's return policy.",

That said, I've heard better things about the S7 edge and Note 7 but the note costs about 800 on contract and that is just absurd. Buy the 5x while the eBay sale is going on. You can get it for 200 new. If you want a bigger phone both the 6P and IPhone 6S are better. For a decent smaller sized the Oneplus Three is insanely fast with no bloat ware.",

After wandering in the cel phone wilderness for the last year or so, the electronics giant pulled their collective heads out of their collective hindquarters and have delivered a very good (if not quite great) flagship mobile device. The past 12-16 months gave us the X, the X Compact, the X Performance, the XZ, the XZS, the XA1, and a gaggle of other mid-tier offerings from Sony. Of them, only the XZS and the XZ Premium could come close to laying claim to flagship status, with the latter coming with one of the finest 4K displays in the business. Unfortunately XZS didn't come with a battery big enough to power the nice phone specs, and the XZ Premium was an exceptionally large phone, at an exceptionally large price. The XZ1 sees the company step up it's game. As of this writing, it's one of the few devices shipping with Android 8 / Oreo out of the box, running the latest Snapdragon 835 processor, with a beautiful 1080 display and a slightly-refined physical design and sturdy-feeling build-quality. And for nearly $700, it certainly should have a premium feel to it. Even the best phones are balancing acts of compromise, so while there's certainly something here for everyone, it's also unlikely to appeal to absolutely everyone. Most people either love or hate Sony's take on industrial design. Some bemoan the size of the top and bottom bezels. In a world where the S8 strives to give customers nothing-but-screen, Sony certainly isn't following the fashion train. But they sure as heck are following the functional-device-train. Having owned an S8, I certainly see the appeal. It's a beautiful looking device. But at the end of the day, I found the lack of bezels to be a problem in day to day use. With no edge on which to rest fingertips, I was constantly accidentally activating various apps, or accidentally hitting the wrong onscreen area within a given app. Nice to look at...but darn if it's not a pain to actually use. So, here's a subjective run down of Pros and Cons: PRO - Great screen. In addition to it's Triluminous setting, Sony has added a new video color-saturating setting. Honestly, it looks like they're taking a stab at the popping colors and deep blacks on OLED devices like the S8. And they've done a good job...this is one of the sharpest, most color popping screens out there at the moment. - Great processor. The new Snapdragon is great. Everything runs smoothly. - Headphone jack / Audio processing. Yay for hanging on to this bit of tech, the old headphone jack. Bluetooth headphones are well and good, but they eat up a battery, and they can't deliver the same quality of audio as a wired set. If how your music sounds on your device is important to you, wired is still the way to go. For now at least. And Sony's DESS audio processing sounds pretty great to my ears. Pick up a third party audio player like Neutron if you'd like even more control of the sound. CON - Physical design. This really doesn't belong in the \"con\" column, but the fact is either you like what Sony is doing here, or you don't. - Price. Sony offers a handful of budget models, but their flagship line has never been anything but pricey. Especially in America where the brand isn't known for it's mobile devices, the average android user might be hard pressed to pay $699 to a company they normally associate with televisions. In Europe and Asia, though, Sony remains a popular contender with Samsung and Apple for high end devices. - Battery. This also might not be a negative, as the new Snapdragon and Oreo are alleged to be more efficient with their power use. Running some benchmarks seem to bear this out, as while it leads in most areas, there are some processes they've scaled back. So far, I don't see any penalty in processing power, but I've also not had it long enough to take a firm stance on battery life. But anecdotally, it does seem to be an improvement over the XZS and XZ Performance.",

        "review": "Awesome phone. best on market..Best phone. Things you should know. 1. Best battery life than any other Android phone I have had. 2. Most features that are exclusive for this phone I thought I would use. I do not. For example I do not use the stylus as much as I did. The recent update killed the ease of use and coverting text from handwriting to text. So I do not use it anymore. 3. Fast response. Have had this phone for about 9 months. Still just as fast responding to touch and opening apps as day one. 4. Can only be used with a max mini SD card of 64gb. This is a minor complaint only. 5. Does not get hot. Unless you are doing a lot of stuff while charging this device does not get hot to the touch. The normal running temp is about 100 degrees Fahrenheit but you can not feel it. 6. Charges fast from dead to full charge. This is based on stock charger that comes with phone which pushes 2.1 amps. I also use a 3.5 amp car charger which it charges faster with. 7. The IR ability I use a lot for controlling my TV and dvr. The app the phone comes with is the best app but the app does need improvement though this is not the phones fault. 8. WiFi is fast. My Internet speed tops at 40mb/s and the phone WiFi can do it. Unlike most phones WiFi usually cap at 20mb/s no matter what. 9. I have the Verizon 4G lte and the lte I have seen push 60mb/s for speeds so again the phone ability for strong and fast signal is impressive. A bunch of other things positive and negative. I am disappointed in Samsung and their lack more rather restrictions of app abilities but this is not the phone fault. Great phone and best I have had.",

I've been unimpressed by Apple's lack of innovation in recent years and decided to try the mate 20 Pro after doing a lot of research and reading a lot of reviews. This phone lives up to the hype and has exceeded all of my expectations! The camera is amazing, the resolution of the screen is beautiful, and the operating system took a little getting used to but the EMUI skin that Huawei utilises seems to be slightly inspired by iOS. I haven't noticed any of the green screen bleed that some people mention and I also can't attest to the overall security of the phone (alleged Chinese malware and spying). This phone is honestly so amazing that even if the spying allegations are true I'd still own/use this phone!",

Android users can't go wrong with this..Well, since I'm far from the first review of this phone I won't go into all the features (which I've only scratched the surface of anyway!). Instead I'll just give my overall impressions. I LOVE this phone. It looks great, fantastic screen and size, it's thin and light. The speed is excellent on just about every app and feature I've used. I really have no complaints after about 2 weeks of using it. Oh, battery life ... having had the S2 before this with battery life of - maybe - half a day this is a pleasure. For example, as I write this at about 11pm after an admittedly light usage day, the battery is still at 74% I'm not saying this is the norm but so far I have not had a day where the phone would have died before the end of the day if I hadn't charged it. We'll see how that holds up over time but for now, battery life is excellent. BATTERY UPDATE: Have had the phone close to 2 weeks now and I must say that battery life has been more than acceptable. Today is a fairly typical day I think. As I write this around 3:30pm I'm at close to 70% battery life. Considering that it was fully charged at 6:30am I'd say that's not too bad. Hope this is helpful. Oh, and as a kicker, I managed to snag this for $0.01 thanks to an unannounced (as far as I know) Amazon sale so that makes this phone even sweeter. Thanks Samsung ... thanks Amazon [it pays to poke around the site on Thanksgiving night!! lol] If you're an android user or switching to it, get this phone!! Hope this is helpful to some of you.",

I really have no complaints after about 2 weeks of using it. The speed is excellent on just about every app and feature I've used. If you're an android user or switching to it, get this phone!!"

I took hundreds of pictures - only one picture from the entire trip backed up to google, and it was a picture from the middle of the trip! When I returned to the states, the phone locked and will only unlock with a factory reset, which will lose all my pictures that are on it. I called Google Help, Verizon Help, Pixel Help and after hours of attempts from these technicians - the phone would still not get out of the unlock loop. I now have a very expensive paperweight and no pictures from a once in a lifetime trip!",

        "review": "You get what you pay for, but you do get a lot for the price w this phone..I don't think you could beat this for the price. I will say there is definitely a noticeable difference with processing compared to like an iPhone. when this does come into play is if you're using Google maps and you're trying to zoom in real fast or out. and sometimes the typing does not catch the proper letters and I think it has to do with this phone. Also sometimes when I use speak to text it's not responsive and I have to say the same thing twice which can definitely be annoying. but overall you cant complain too much with a phone like this for the price. It's funny, even while writing this review twice the speak to text did not respond. But again it takes pretty decent photos and it's impressive the low light photos that it takes. The phone seems to work okay and I've never really had a problem connecting to Wi-Fi etc. I'm definitely going back to the iPhone though I'll tell you that. I purchased this because I was in another country and I didn't have a choice. But it has done the job so if you're really really tight on money I would say this is a good option for you for sure or the newer Moto G7",

After repeated checks with my service provider it was confirmed that the problem was with the phone and not the service. This was verified through various forums and chats by other persons in different countries with the S10 who had the same problem. Whenever I leave an area with wifi, I have to go to the sim card manager and change from 4g to 3g then back to 4g to get mobile data. As soon as I get a call I lose mobile data and have to go 3g then 4g again to get it back. Same thing if the signal gets weak or I go in and out of a wifi area. Huge risk if attempted while driving. I have reset the phone, reseated the sim card and tried other recommended fixes to no avail. No warranty so buyer beware. Very disappointed.",
