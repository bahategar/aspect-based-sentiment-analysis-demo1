I am not a car person as I drove my Honda Civic for 19 years and the only reason I decide to trade it in is because during winter my door froze and I was stuck inside the car until I kicked it open 😠 I got a whopping $700 for my trade in. ....Oh well two day ago this car was again parked outside a sandwich shop....so I have seen this car twice!!! Why is this called a truck? It sure looks like a car!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I don't know why people get the idea that hospital bills in the US are insane here inside this comment section. My mother uses Medicare and is absolutely fine (it is there for people who apply for it but people don't apply for it). I have insurance as well, which would have been paid by taxes anyways that I'd have to put into if we had your style of system. Are there issues with the healthcare system? Yes. Is Europe absolutely perfect with its healthcare, despite how much funding goes into it? No. It has many flaws. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese black and white blanket statements are rather silly. Every country has their pros and cons. Europeans don't understand that the US itself is ALMOST as large as all of Europe combined. Imagine driving from the top most point of Europe to the southern most point and see how long that would take you. We have far larger surface area to get to places and different issues because of it. One country has to deal with a very tiny amount of road space compared to the US. We have much larger roads so it can accommodate trucking because it is how we can best get inventory all across of the nation (think of trying to do that for all of Europe with our size comparison). \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also have a different culture and different interests. We have many, many different cultures within the US. You go one state over and you'll find a ton of differences in way of thinking and doing things. It would be better to compare the US by states like you do European countries because that is what it would be like for size comparison. You should compare healthcare by state to other EU countries healthcare. And not every EU healthcare is that great, let's be honest. And Europe has almost 2.5x the population as the United States with a lot more infrastructure built over thousands of years. How can you compare that to a country as young as the US. Let's be honest here.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrime rate? \\r\\n\\r\\nLuxembourg has a murder rate of 1.39 per 100,000 people.\\r\\nLatvia has a 4.05%.\\r\\nFinland has a 1.5%.\\r\\nTurkey has a 2.46%.\\r\\nEstonia has a 1.35%.\\r\\nLithuania is 2.21%.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about the US?\\r\\n\\r\\nMaine's murder rate is 1.03% WHAT?! No way! Lower than EU ?!\\r\\nNew Hampshire is 1.26%\\r\\nConnecticut is 1.5%\\r\\nMississippi is 2.45%\\r\\nKentucky is 2.14%\\r\\n\\r\\nIs the US generally less safe than Europe? Yes. We also have many things and rights that EU doesn't have or apparently want, which is fine. People will vote and choose to live how they want. If the US wants what they have then what right do you have to try and tell them otherwise. EU is far from perfect. Just as the US is far from perfect. Work on your own country and stop attacking others. Maybe you'll make your home a better place to live rather than typing random stuff on a video you probably should never have watched to begin with since it doesn't sell to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI find many of these arguments very pointless. Countries are different and do things differently. Why you won't conform to the way the US does things the US won't conform to the way you do things. Just live your life in your culture and if you don't like the car, then don't buy it. I don't know why you'd be on this video if it isn't something you're invested in getting. It just feels like hate mobbing, throwing hatred at something you, as you say, never see where you're from. Why can't people just enjoy things that they enjoy? If people like the big truck and a place allows it and the voters are fine with it in that country, then let it be.\",\n",

I figured I was somewhere between 150k-200k based on some articles I read at the time. The recent recalls where they are forced to publish figures suggest Tesla made some 12K trucks by July 2024. So, how did I get invited unless like 80-90% dropped out?!\\n2. I am looking on CarGurus now and the Cyberbeast, which is like 131k for the tag, is being sold in multiple states for 140k-143k which is a modest premium and is almost breakeven\\n\\nDoes this sound like what was advertised? I think I have another 2-3 months before they call me for the final payment and delivery but this is starting to look like a major flop and I might have to walk away since cheaper to let go of the deposits than pick up a car which could be depreciating like the rest of the Teslas.

       "  'review': 'Yeah Marques I\\'m gonna be honest I\\'ve been kinda falling out of love with your reviews the last few years and I think this was the final nail in the coffin. Too many reviews where you fall over yourself to manufacture an enthusiasm about something that is obviously very flawed, to the point of glossing over and sometimes outright ignoring a lot of glaring issues. From the beginning I already couldn\\'t take this video seriously, the montage of people taking pictures just made me roll my eyes so hard, especially with the hindsight that most of those folks were almost certainly taking pictures to make fun of it to their friends later. And to call that the \"most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck\" while speeding past it\\'s more minor, well-known issues and then not addressing any of the other more serious problems that make this hunk of junk as unsafe as it is. This review has already aged very poorly in just a few months, but that into is gonna mean less than nothing in like four months when the novelty of seeing one in the wild has worn off and the general public has gotten bored or tired of seeing it. Hell, if anything the more real \"danger\" is that I\\'d be willing to bet a significant amount of drivers will be nastier to and more inclined to drive aggressively around a Cybertruck than other vehicles. \\n\\nI just kinda feel like if you\\'re not gonna take a product review seriously and be honest and real about it, why do the review at all?\\n\\nHaven\\'t seen the video you did about it for your car review channel, hoping that one is better but I\\'m not holding my breath.

The tires were damaged from the wheel covers, the dash panel was warped for some reason, and the bedcover was crooked. Also, I found out from the owner that this thing is so dangerous it can’t pass European safety standards. The leeway given in these reviews by Marques, saying future builds will fix all of these issues, is mind blowing to me. Especially, given the inconsistency in his criticism compared to other product reviews… Tearing other products apart for not launching in the condition for which they were promised by the company before launch, but in this video he just makes excuses again and again for all of the glaring problems and missing features when it comes to this literally poorly made steel death machine. It’s kind of astounding. Personally, I did find the drive by wire steering to be the best thing about the cybertruck after driving it. But they could have put that technology in anything else that wasn’t just poorly designed and poorly manufactured in so many other respects. I honestly question Marques’ ethical principles as a reviewer after watching these cybertruck reviews in comparison to his other reviews. Just disappointing.',\n",

Sure this is great if you live in a high crime area but, what would happen if you went off a bridge? I can\\'t say ive seen one submerged so i don\\'t know exactly how it would go, but normal procedure is, unbuckle, grab something for breaking the window and bust out the back windshield. How are you going to do that with this? \\n4 You didn\\'t mention a common problem with Tesla cars in general, that the doors are completely powered by the battery. ( Some may be different, i don\\'t know ) And there are many reports of their battery dying for one reason or not, and becoming unable to get in or out of the car. If this \\'truck\\' were to have this problem, how would you get out/back in? You can\\'t get out the windows thats for sure, and tow companys are going to have a hell of a time getting it to a shop of its stuck in park.\\nI can understand if maybe you didn\\'t want to include these because they specifically weren\\'t your experience, but they should atleast have a footnote in the video instead of completely ignored.

If the exterior of the car doesn't budge on impact, all the strength of the hit ill go to launching you forwards, making it way more likely that you'll get hurt or worse. An the same goes for any other car you carsh with, the cyber truck absorbs no force in said impact compared to normal cars. That, and wind resistance is also a factor in efficiency as you said. The point is, no one is making them like that because they're smarter than tat. An being iconic in exchange for being less safe, not worth it. Also, it's iconic, but ugly, that's just that.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Idk Mk there\\'s a lot of things that you left out of this review or at least could have mentioned that make it feel like you were intentionally going soft of Tesla for one reason or another:\\n1. The stainless steel panels rust very easily (anything from dead bugs to bird droppings can lead to rusting) and the panels will start to change colour if exposed to water whilst in the sun (something like the second CT at 26:01).\\n2. To avoid the rusting problem Tesla charges 5k to put a protective coating on the panels which they should have put on it in the first place\\n3. The panels are not fucking bulletproof\\n4. Drag racing it is pretty dumb if you are not going to be towing stuff either. One could argue that the people who buy the CT are more likely to tow something than ever be in any form of race with it.\\n5. For a truck it has a very tiny bay, no bigger than the average Suzuki light truck, this is a very important bit of information considering how that bay size dictates how much you can potentially carry. You didn\\'t at all dwell on this part and only briefly touched on it by saying you and your crew use it to move your equipment but exactly how much equipment was that bro? Surely you caould have taken 2 or 3 minutes to just show how many grocery bags or suitcases can fit in the bay and taken 2 or 3 less minutes glazing the \"iconic design\" \\n6. For health and safety reasons it is entirely irresponsible to not accurately communicate how much of a bruising and cutting hazard the sharp steel edges of the doors actually are, I have seen videos of carrots getting sliced and chopped against the edges of the door, they\\'re like fucking katanas 😂.\\nAnyway, I hope in a year or so we can get a more well rounded review from you tackling the issues I\\'ve just highlighted, especially number 6 because if anyone who owns a toddler has designs on buying this dumb truck, they should at least know that it comes with the possibility of leaving their toddler devoid of a finger or two.',\n",

It's like a 2006 Honda Ridgeline drawn by a 4 year old made by a company whose grifter CEO acts like a 5 year old. Tesla was already the epitome of 'Form over Function' due to prioritizing aesthetics and high profit margins (for example, by removing radar and ultrasonic sensors for cheaper optical cameras), but this model takes that to a new low by having a hideous form. I've seen several in person (both standard and ones with wraps), and they're hideous and ridiculous. The production quality is predictably horrible (the production issues as addressed in the video are inexcusable for such a tiny run of *luxury* vehicles), repairs are absurdly expensive, and the brake lights don't work properly. The actual utility of it (as mentioned in the video) is laughable because it has low towing power,  you can't fit much in the truck bed, it has difficulty going up inclines that over vehicles climb with ease, the range is significantly less than advertised, the battery compartment is only half full, and it needs to be cleaned off shortly after getting wet. Tesla even says you shouldn't take it through a car wash! It's not bulletproof except against a small percentage of handguns, and the height and design of the vehicle makes it difficult to see pedestrians in front of you. Yoke steering wheels are also a known safety hazard. But hey, you do you I guess.\\n\\nAnother fun fact is that working at Tesla is dangerous because the company is infamous for ignoring safety best practices in their factories because Musk hates the color yellow, doesn't like safety signs, and doesn't like beeping noises. Not sure why he even cares what the factories look like, since he's not an engineer, he apparently doesn't care about the condition Tesla vehicles leave the factories in, and he's on Twitter all the time anyway.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'In the current age of mass information - nothing material can be iconic. There is nothing that is unbelievable or not seen before. The social networks made the sharing of ideas available for absolutely every person in the world. The inventions became just trends, the misteries became debunked in the comments, the heroes became influencers in order to monetize their status. And that is fine - just this is the product of the reality, that we live in. If there was Instagram during the Trojan War, Achilles would be a viral star and he will leave Hector alive, so can make a podcast with him later on youtube. Last week I was exploring Milano. During one of the evenings I was waiting the metro to arrive and there were multiple screens on the walls of the station. They were showing the Pope reading statesments about the situation in Israel. And on the bottom there was a banner with a brief information. On the left it was written \"PAPA\", which is Pope in italian. But not \"the Pope\" (Il Papa), not Pope Francis, but just \"PAPA\". There were around 50 people around. May be I was the only one who was watching the broadcast with the Pope. Nobody was interested at all and this is in Italy. Can you imagine in 15 or 16th Century, what it would be to see and listen to the pope. One of a kind experience in your life, almost like a devine moment. Now some influencers who give money if you are the last one leaving a red circle on the ground, are more important for the people than the pope. But here is the difference. Nobody is interested in Mr Beast as a human, or even as a YouTube genius. 99% are interested in his money and his exposure. You need him either to earn easy money, or to receive gigantic advertising, hence again earn a lot of money. When the legend has a price it turns to a bestseller. Mr Beast is not and he will never be an icon. The CyberTruck is not and it will never be an icon. Not in the Today\\'s world. It is impossible. The money are the God of Internet and \"in GOD we TRUST\" (TRUST not Believe). The Saint halo is a \"Verified\" badge. That is what you need to see in order to be sure that this is the real \"devine\" person. There is this show on NG \"The best of the decades\"... and they show the icons of each DECADE. Icon for a decade? Some of the saints are icons for 2000 years.  This is what happens when you bind the virtues with money. The future of the human kind doesn\\'t rely on how popular we are, it relies on how sustainable we are as a society. The real science knowledge, the real art and the real life virtues brought us to the 21st Century. Only if you are considered a true genius in those 3 life aspects, you can become a true icon. The Cybertruck will be just a cool truck with a cool story in 10 years, but Elon Musk will be considered as a genius even after 100 years. Elon is the Icon, not the Cybertruck. Nobody remembers who was a millionaire in Salzburg in the times of Mozart, but Mozart is still considered one of the greatest geniuses of the Music for all times. Nobody speaks about the wealthy nobles who ordered Da Vinci to paint for them. But Da Vinci is still considered as a science and an art genius for almost 500 years already. And that is their purpose - to give the human kind a good future, or we will extinct. The human kind exists for around a million years, and our modern world and society exists only for two Centuries. We are frighteningly close to reverse the process. The idea to make the people good hearted and educated, the society to be sustainable, is what keeps the ICONS alive. Everything other lives shortly and will be forgotten.',\n",

Ironically I would bet that it will eventually end up in a Chinese metal and electronics recycling facility. Industrial dishwashers are made from higher grade stainless steel than the body of that truck. Anyone with knowledge of metal compositions can tell you that stainless steel has several grades and anything other than 316 grade stainless steel which is the highest grade, 316 grade stainless steel is actually mandatory grade for work surfaces that must be used for any commercial or industrial kitchens in many regions, since it doesn't corrode or rust so it can be used for food prep and not become rusty when exposed to salt and water which are the most common kitchen ingredients but also what will make exposed steel or cheap stainless steel to rust. The cybertruck body is made from 300 grade stainless, which will definitely rust when driven in the rust belt during the winter, especially if taken on salted highways in the winter. The choice to use 300 grade stainless maybe because of cost or weight, but the same process is used to fabricate and cut panels to shape 300 grade stainless and it wouldnt be any more difficult to create the body from 316 stainless steel which is actually rust resistant, also easier to clean, and 300 grade stainless is only slightly more durable than just a standard sheet metal. I have a garbage can thats made of higher grade stainless steel than the Cybertruck.\",\n",

My mother uses Medicare and is absolutely fine (it is there for people who apply for it but people don't apply for it). I have insurance as well, which would have been paid by taxes anyways that I'd have to put into if we had your style of system. Are there issues with the healthcare system? Yes. Is Europe absolutely perfect with its healthcare, despite how much funding goes into it? No. It has many flaws. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese black and white blanket statements are rather silly. Every country has their pros and cons. Europeans don't understand that the US itself is ALMOST as large as all of Europe combined. Imagine driving from the top most point of Europe to the southern most point and see how long that would take you. We have far larger surface area to get to places and different issues because of it. One country has to deal with a very tiny amount of road space compared to the US. We have much larger roads so it can accommodate trucking because it is how we can best get inventory all across of the nation (think of trying to do that for all of Europe with our size comparison). \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also have a different culture and different interests. We have many, many different cultures within the US. You go one state over and you'll find a ton of differences in way of thinking and doing things. It would be better to compare the US by states like you do European countries because that is what it would be like for size comparison. You should compare healthcare by state to other EU countries healthcare. And not every EU healthcare is that great, let's be honest. And Europe has almost 2.5x the population as the United States with a lot more infrastructure built over thousands of years. How can you compare that to a country as young as the US. Let's be honest here.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrime rate? \\r\\n\\r\\nLuxembourg has a murder rate of 1.39 per 100,000 people.\\r\\nLatvia has a 4.05%.\\r\\nFinland has a 1.5%.\\r\\nTurkey has a 2.46%.\\r\\nEstonia has a 1.35%.\\r\\nLithuania is 2.21%.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about the US?\\r\\n\\r\\nMaine's murder rate is 1.03% WHAT?! No way! Lower than EU ?!\\r\\nNew Hampshire is 1.26%\\r\\nConnecticut is 1.5%\\r\\nMississippi is 2.45%\\r\\nKentucky is 2.14%\\r\\n\\r\\nIs the US generally less safe than Europe? Yes. We also have many things and rights that EU doesn't have or apparently want, which is fine. People will vote and choose to live how they want. If the US wants what they have then what right do you have to try and tell them otherwise. EU is far from perfect. Just as the US is far from perfect. Work on your own country and stop attacking others. Maybe you'll make your home a better place to live rather than typing random stuff on a video you probably should never have watched to begin with since it doesn't sell to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nI find many of these arguments very pointless. Countries are different and do things differently. Why you won't conform to the way the US does things the US won't conform to the way you do things. Just live your life in your culture and if you don't like the car, then don't buy it. I don't know why you'd be on this video if it isn't something you're invested in getting. It just feels like hate mobbing, throwing hatred at something you, as you say, never see where you're from. Why can't people just enjoy things that they enjoy? If people like the big truck and a place allows it and the voters are fine with it in that country, then let it be.\",\n",

I figured I was somewhere between 150k-200k based on some articles I read at the time. The recent recalls where they are forced to publish figures suggest Tesla made some 12K trucks by July 2024. So, how did I get invited unless like 80-90% dropped out?!\\n2. I am looking on CarGurus now and the Cyberbeast, which is like 131k for the tag, is being sold in multiple states for 140k-143k which is a modest premium and is almost breakeven\\n\\nDoes this sound like what was advertised? I think I have another 2-3 months before they call me for the final payment and delivery but this is starting to look like a major flop and I might have to walk away since cheaper to let go of the deposits than pick up a car which could be depreciating like the rest of the Teslas. Where can I see reliable information on how many cars they made and how many preorders still exist?\\n\\nAlso, was considering renting it on Turo for like $350-400/day.

Too many reviews where you fall over yourself to manufacture an enthusiasm about something that is obviously very flawed, to the point of glossing over and sometimes outright ignoring a lot of glaring issues. From the beginning I already couldn\\'t take this video seriously, the montage of people taking pictures just made me roll my eyes so hard, especially with the hindsight that most of those folks were almost certainly taking pictures to make fun of it to their friends later. And to call that the \"most dangerous thing about the Cybertruck\" while speeding past it\\'s more minor, well-known issues and then not addressing any of the other more serious problems that make this hunk of junk as unsafe as it is. This review has already aged very poorly in just a few months, but that into is gonna mean less than nothing in like four months when the novelty of seeing one in the wild has worn off and the general public has gotten bored or tired of seeing it. Hell, if anything the more real \"danger\" is that I\\'d be willing to bet a significant amount of drivers will be nastier to and more inclined to drive aggressively around a Cybertruck than other vehicles. \\n\\nI just kinda feel like if you\\'re not gonna take a product review seriously and be honest and real about it, why do the review at all?\\n\\nHaven\\'t seen the video you did about it for your car review channel, hoping that one is better but I\\'m not holding my breath.

Not only that, but Elon is selling cars allegedly to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but has joined forces with a political party that has worked to prevent any Climate legislation for 40 years.

The tires were damaged from the wheel covers, the dash panel was warped for some reason, and the bedcover was crooked. Also, I found out from the owner that this thing is so dangerous it can’t pass European safety standards. The leeway given in these reviews by Marques, saying future builds will fix all of these issues, is mind blowing to me. Especially, given the inconsistency in his criticism compared to other product reviews… Tearing other products apart for not launching in the condition for which they were promised by the company before launch, but in this video he just makes excuses again and again for all of the glaring problems and missing features when it comes to this literally poorly made steel death machine. It’s kind of astounding. Personally, I did find the drive by wire steering to be the best thing about the cybertruck after driving it. But they could have put that technology in anything else that wasn’t just poorly designed and poorly manufactured in so many other respects. I honestly question Marques’ ethical principles as a reviewer after watching these cybertruck reviews in comparison to his other reviews. Just disappointing.',\n",

Most of the need is better served by vans and for the bit where a pickup truck is needed, the bedspace of modern (especially teslas) pickup trucks is bs. \\n\\nOh also bulletproof steel? its bullet resistence is far overstated. \\n\\nPersonal vehicles dont exist in a vacuum and glossing over its myriad of flaws is promoting a vehicle that is unnecessarily dangerous just because, and it is not fine because it looks good, it makes streets mroe dangeorus, it makes congestion worse, it does mroe damage to roads, and for what, it looking cooler?',\n",

Cars are made to crumple so that the kinetic energy, the force of the crash goes through the car itself instead of your body. Whiplash at best and seriously injured at worst from a simple crash. \\n2 You did not mention the \"Car wash mode\" at all. They did not make the seals to the power points well enough to keep water out so they made that mode to close those parts and protect the car. But if you have adhd like me or just having a stressful/busy day, you will forget and brick your \\'truck\\'. Not to mention I\\'ve seen posts about this happening and it will void the warranty so you\\'re screwed. \\n3 You did mention that the windows are stronger than normal but, specifically they are meant to be shatterproof. Sure this is great if you live in a high crime area but, what would happen if you went off a bridge? I can\\'t say ive seen one submerged so i don\\'t know exactly how it would go, but normal procedure is, unbuckle, grab something for breaking the window and bust out the back windshield. How are you going to do that with this? \\n4 You didn\\'t mention a common problem with Tesla cars in general, that the doors are completely powered by the battery. ( Some may be different, i don\\'t know ) And there are many reports of their battery dying for one reason or not, and becoming unable to get in or out of the car. If this \\'truck\\' were to have this problem, how would you get out/back in? You can\\'t get out the windows thats for sure, and tow companys are going to have a hell of a time getting it to a shop of its stuck in park.\\nI can understand if maybe you didn\\'t want to include these because they specifically weren\\'t your experience, but they should atleast have a footnote in the video instead of completely ignored. (These issues are just from a couple other videos I\\'ve seen and im sure there will be more.)',\n",

Its a SUV in a shape of a truck (because its bad at everything that a truck should do), it has shoddy build quality (just look at the discolered doors - that can't be intentional), almost all controls are on the touch screen making it very distracing for the driver to use. And thats all aside from the design, which is controverial and I peronally don't like it, but I can see how somebody else can like it, even if its just for the novelty.\\nSo I all you want is essentially a SUV with a extravagant design and care more about how you are seen on the road than what the car actually does for you, its the car for you.\",\n",

The stainless steel panels rust very easily (anything from dead bugs to bird droppings can lead to rusting) and the panels will start to change colour if exposed to water whilst in the sun (something like the second CT at 26:01).\\n2. To avoid the rusting problem Tesla charges 5k to put a protective coating on the panels which they should have put on it in the first place\\n3. The panels are not fucking bulletproof\\n4. Drag racing it is pretty dumb if you are not going to be towing stuff either. One could argue that the people who buy the CT are more likely to tow something than ever be in any form of race with it.\\n5. For a truck it has a very tiny bay, no bigger than the average Suzuki light truck, this is a very important bit of information considering how that bay size dictates how much you can potentially carry. You didn\\'t at all dwell on this part and only briefly touched on it by saying you and your crew use it to move your equipment but exactly how much equipment was that bro? Surely you caould have taken 2 or 3 minutes to just show how many grocery bags or suitcases can fit in the bay and taken 2 or 3 less minutes glazing the \"iconic design\" \\n6. For health and safety reasons it is entirely irresponsible to not accurately communicate how much of a bruising and cutting hazard the sharp steel edges of the doors actually are, I have seen videos of carrots getting sliced and chopped against the edges of the door, they\\'re like fucking katanas 😂.\\nAnyway, I hope in a year or so we can get a more well rounded review from you tackling the issues I\\'ve just highlighted, especially number 6 because if anyone who owns a toddler has designs on buying this dumb truck, they should at least know that it comes with the possibility of leaving their toddler devoid of a finger or two.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Owning (or wanting to own) a Cybertruck is the new Mid-Life Crisis cry for help/desperate bid to be relevant. It's like a 2006 Honda Ridgeline drawn by a 4 year old made by a company whose grifter CEO acts like a 5 year old. Tesla was already the epitome of 'Form over Function' due to prioritizing aesthetics and high profit margins (for example, by removing radar and ultrasonic sensors for cheaper optical cameras), but this model takes that to a new low by having a hideous form. I've seen several in person (both standard and ones with wraps), and they're hideous and ridiculous. The production quality is predictably horrible (the production issues as addressed in the video are inexcusable for such a tiny run of *luxury* vehicles), repairs are absurdly expensive, and the brake lights don't work properly. The actual utility of it (as mentioned in the video) is laughable because it has low towing power,  you can't fit much in the truck bed, it has difficulty going up inclines that over vehicles climb with ease, the range is significantly less than advertised, the battery compartment is only half full, and it needs to be cleaned off shortly after getting wet. Tesla even says you shouldn't take it through a car wash! It's not bulletproof except against a small percentage of handguns, and the height and design of the vehicle makes it difficult to see pedestrians in front of you. Yoke steering wheels are also a known safety hazard. But hey, you do you I guess.\\n\\nAnother fun fact is that working at Tesla is dangerous because the company is infamous for ignoring safety best practices in their factories because Musk hates the color yellow, doesn't like safety signs, and doesn't like beeping noises. Not sure why he even cares what the factories look like, since he's not an engineer, he apparently doesn't care about the condition Tesla vehicles leave the factories in, and he's on Twitter all the time anyway.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'In the current age of mass information - nothing material can be iconic. There is nothing that is unbelievable or not seen before. The social networks made the sharing of ideas available for absolutely every person in the world. The inventions became just trends, the misteries became debunked in the comments, the heroes became influencers in order to monetize their status. And that is fine - just this is the product of the reality, that we live in. If there was Instagram during the Trojan War, Achilles would be a viral star and he will leave Hector alive, so can make a podcast with him later on youtube. Last week I was exploring Milano. During one of the evenings I was waiting the metro to arrive and there were multiple screens on the walls of the station. They were showing the Pope reading statesments about the situation in Israel. And on the bottom there was a banner with a brief information. On the left it was written \"PAPA\", which is Pope in italian. But not \"the Pope\" (Il Papa), not Pope Francis, but just \"PAPA\". There were around 50 people around. May be I was the only one who was watching the broadcast with the Pope. Nobody was interested at all and this is in Italy. Can you imagine in 15 or 16th Century, what it would be to see and listen to the pope. One of a kind experience in your life, almost like a devine moment. Now some influencers who give money if you are the last one leaving a red circle on the ground, are more important for the people than the pope. But here is the difference. Nobody is interested in Mr Beast as a human, or even as a YouTube genius. 99% are interested in his money and his exposure. You need him either to earn easy money, or to receive gigantic advertising, hence again earn a lot of money. When the legend has a price it turns to a bestseller. Mr Beast is not and he will never be an icon. The CyberTruck is not and it will never be an icon. Not in the Today\\'s world. It is impossible. The money are the God of Internet and \"in GOD we TRUST\" (TRUST not Believe). The Saint halo is a \"Verified\" badge. That is what you need to see in order to be sure that this is the real \"devine\" person. There is this show on NG \"The best of the decades\"... and they show the icons of each DECADE. Icon for a decade? Some of the saints are icons for 2000 years.  This is what happens when you bind the virtues with money. The future of the human kind doesn\\'t rely on how popular we are, it relies on how sustainable we are as a society. The real science knowledge, the real art and the real life virtues brought us to the 21st Century. Only if you are considered a true genius in those 3 life aspects, you can become a true icon. The Cybertruck will be just a cool truck with a cool story in 10 years, but Elon Musk will be considered as a genius even after 100 years. Elon is the Icon, not the Cybertruck. Nobody remembers who was a millionaire in Salzburg in the times of Mozart, but Mozart is still considered one of the greatest geniuses of the Music for all times. Nobody speaks about the wealthy nobles who ordered Da Vinci to paint for them. But Da Vinci is still considered as a science and an art genius for almost 500 years already. And that is their purpose - to give the human kind a good future, or we will extinct. The human kind exists for around a million years, and our modern world and society exists only for two Centuries. We are frighteningly close to reverse the process. The idea to make the people good hearted and educated, the society to be sustainable, is what keeps the ICONS alive. Everything other lives shortly and will be forgotten.',\n",

Ironically I would bet that it will eventually end up in a Chinese metal and electronics recycling facility. Industrial dishwashers are made from higher grade stainless steel than the body of that truck. Anyone with knowledge of metal compositions can tell you that stainless steel has several grades and anything other than 316 grade stainless steel which is the highest grade, 316 grade stainless steel is actually mandatory grade for work surfaces that must be used for any commercial or industrial kitchens in many regions, since it doesn't corrode or rust so it can be used for food prep and not become rusty when exposed to salt and water which are the most common kitchen ingredients but also what will make exposed steel or cheap stainless steel to rust. The cybertruck body is made from 300 grade stainless, which will definitely rust when driven in the rust belt during the winter, especially if taken on salted highways in the winter. The choice to use 300 grade stainless maybe because of cost or weight, but the same process is used to fabricate and cut panels to shape 300 grade stainless and it wouldnt be any more difficult to create the body from 316 stainless steel which is actually rust resistant, also easier to clean, and 300 grade stainless is only slightly more durable than just a standard sheet metal. I have a garbage can thats made of higher grade stainless steel than the Cybertruck.\",\n",
