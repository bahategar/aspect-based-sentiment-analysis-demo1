I sat in the drive thru for almost an hour waiting to get my order taken, the line was wrapped almost TWICE around the building, and finally I gave up and tried driving up to the window to give them my order since i was next in line. When i got to the window, they told me they couldn't take it and I'd have to go back around. I told them I'd like to put in my order here since I've been waiting all this time, and they proceeded to still refuse and that it's my fault for waiting in the second lane that they claimed was closed and had a sign out. The second lane was open, and the \"sign\" they were talking about was a wet floor sign they had placed right next to the drive-thru menu. I told them the lane looked open from our side and they still proceeded to argue with me, and then slammed the drive thru window shut. I've never received such deplorable customer service in my life, and if any managers are reading this, I highly suggest firing the two workers from last night.",

I was happy there was an option for 24-hr food in case I wanted something on the way home from a night out with friends or just late-night munchies.  During the day, it's a pretty average McD's.  But they lost my business forever when I went by one night at 1am, pulled up to the order box, waited for five minutes, then finally someone came over the speaker and said \"Sorry we're closed\".\n\nClosed?!  It's 24-hrs!  And I get it, sometimes 24-hr places will close one night every several months to do a deep cleaning.  I get that, I really do.  But they ALWAYS post signs and notices so you're not blind-sided by it.  Not this place.  I really don't think they were closed.  I think the workers were too lazy to do their job and decided to shut the store down so they could get paid to do nothing.\n\nAdditionally, this store has a bad habit of having a \"broken\" ice cream machine past 10pm.  It's always \"sorry, ice cream machine is broken\" if you come in after the lobby closes.\n\nThe worst part is I complained on the website.  I submitted a complaint for this store, pointing out the 24-hr and the ice cream issue.  All I got back (weeks later) was \"oh, sorry the ice cream machine was broken, we're working to upgrade all our locations but it takes time\"  Not even a single MENTION of the \"closed\" 24-hr location.\n\nAs I said, it's a pretty standard McD's... which is synonymous with lazy, but this one takes the cake on it.",

Chicken sandwich was shriveled and dry like it had been sitting for hours after being over cooked to begin with. There was a small drop of mayo on it and the bun was stale. First time I figured was a one off but the second time I ordered 20 nuggets and fries and a milkshake.  They didn't give a receipt then told me to go park to wait for the food to be ready.  There were no spots open that I could access and the cashier just said 'do whatever' and walked away.  I waited for the car in front of me to move so I could pull around the building and get into a spot but asked first about my shake.  She said they'll bring it.  Waited a few min honestly not long but then they forgot my milkshake and asked me very curtly 'well do you have a receipt? ' clearly not.  Eventually they brought out the shake but fries were old and cold and the shake was melted.",

I was in a rush to get to an appointment so I decided to call to see what was the hold up. Needless to say, the manager Ashleigh that answered the phone was 1. Very rude and 2. She hung up on me after I asked her to have the car in front of me pull up so I can get my meal and leave. When I got to the window, she not only disrespected me but she cursed me out and yelled at me. That is NOT a form of respect especially to a customer and not only that, the ENTIRE staff was fooling around and not getting any of their work done.

I was in a rush to get to an appointment so I decided to call to see what was the hold up. Needless to say, the manager Ashleigh that answered the phone was 1. Very rude and 2. She hung up on me after I asked her to have the car in front of me pull up so I can get my meal and leave. When I got to the window, she not only disrespected me but she cursed me out and yelled at me. That is NOT a form of respect especially to a customer and not only that, the ENTIRE staff was fooling around and not getting any of their work done. Very unprofessional and needless to say, I felt very disrespected and disgusted. I have NEVER been treated in such a more disgusting way than this team that was on today.

The grease from the burger had absorbed into the bread so much that I squeezed the bread and grease dripped from it. The frys were not at all fresh. I threw my meal in the trash where it belonged. Called the store and spoke with John. He apologized and took my name down and I will get a refund but it doesnt help my hunger NOW. Worst encounter with McDonalds ever. And this is why I dont eat there, I'll choose Burger King next time. The carelessness of the staff there really shows and the food they produced tonight was among the worst I have ever seen in the food industry.",

My problem is the workers organization. Nobody is at the register or someone to help you at the kiosk. One kiosk machine did not give you a receipt, another gives you just a white paper. Long wait to pick up order, took like 20 minutes. Once you get your order it is missing items from your order. Today, I was missing hashbrowns. I also ordered hot chocolate with caramel and I got coffee  instead. I did not change it because two weeks ago, the same thing happened and I had to wait 20 more minutes for them to give me the hot chocolate. I thought that was an isolated incident but it happened again today. For this reason I'm not coming back to this place ever again. Goodbye!!!",

We always have an issue at this McDonald's no matter what time of day,  whether we order from a food delivery service or in person. The orders always get screwed up,  from missing items to getting a sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle that just had cheese! If there was other fast food options besides pizza and halal nearby we'd probably never go here again.\nBut today I finally understood why it's a mess: there's no communication. It was a busy time since school had just let out and I stood for about 5 minutes waiting for a Dr. Pepper and watched the crew work in relative silence while pushing out food orders without tickets and without speaking to each other. Anyone who has worked in food service knows a quiet kitchen spells more trouble than a loud one. Eventually my sister flagged down the man doing drink orders and asked if the drink he'd just placed in the row of 8 other drinks he'd been setting down indiscriminately was our Dr. Pepper and he said yes...it was a Coke.\nManagement here really needs to have a talk to the crew about working together as a team and communication, especially when it's busy. Yes it's just a McDonald's, and I'm not expecting white glove service from a fast food joint, but our community deserves better than what we're getting for sure.",

It was a busy time since school had just let out and I stood for about 5 minutes waiting for a Dr. Pepper and watched the crew work in relative silence while pushing out food orders without tickets and without speaking to each other. Anyone who has worked in food service knows a quiet kitchen spells more trouble than a loud one. Eventually my sister flagged down the man doing drink orders and asked if the drink he'd just placed in the row of 8 other drinks he'd been setting down indiscriminately was our Dr. Pepper and he said yes...it was a Coke.\nManagement here really needs to have a talk to the crew about working together as a team and communication, especially when it's busy. Yes it's just a McDonald's, and I'm not expecting white glove service from a fast food joint, but our community deserves better than what we're getting for sure."

Was disappointed to hear that the purple packaging isn't available in the U.S. (@Corporate: missed opportunity!). Hesitant because the paper bag adorned with the BTS logo was not guaranteed to be available at all locations. Fears were quelled, as I saw other guests sitting outside, and the elusive BTS paper bag going for $70+ on eBay was elusive no longer. Utilized the self-service machines to order - quick and easy. Medium and large sizes available (opted for medium, which was more than enough food in hindsight). Liked the Cajun sauce more than the Sweet Chili sauce, but just a personal preference. Total of the medium BTS meal was $8.39 + 0.74 tax = $9.13.

I didn't have any inconvenience, probably because I only order a coffee, but 5 min waiting time were enough to see several clients complaining for a missing item. I think I waited too much for a coffee, but I understand they were really busy. The coffee was good as usual.",

The one at the pick up counter gave a little nod then walked away even though the paper bags were right next to her!! Then I went to the cashier and she just gave me a blank look and motioned to the pick-up counter without saying a word. Then I told the girl yet again, that I need a paper bag please and she just gave me a dumbfounded look with a twang of annoyance and walked away and then fave out more orders. They were just so rude and every other time I've been there! They were all Spanish and maybe don't like Asians but they're horrible people and I never want to go to this location ever again!!!",

All I wanted was a toy for my daughter. Those employees need to get out of there if they dont want to work there."

The stall was big enough to spread out and break that loud up. So I twisted and bounced but the realized I left my Swisher Pack in the stall. I returned and as I was walking in a guy was coming out. He had my wrap pack in his hand to throw away when we connected eyes. So we talked for a second and decided to match. My boy met up too and we burned down. Dude musta threw some PCP on his because I was tripping balls soon after. I woke up the next day naked in a field with the cops asking questions. I dunno man. 5/7 would do again though",

For a McDonald's restaurant it was not very busy. I would definitely go back to this location if I needed to go to McDonalds in New York City. Highly recommend stopping in to this location if you are in the area.",

I told the employee at the speaker that I had an app order to pickup and gave her the code.  She instructed me to go to the first window.  There I was given the receipt, thanked, and told to go to the next window.  At the 2nd window I was told to go to a 3rd window to pickup the order.  The 3rd window is kind of funny, since it seems like an afterthought.  Since it is at the corner of the building close to a sign, it is difficult to get close enough to be handed the order without scraping the side of your car. Then to leave you have to turn your wheels hard right.  The employees were very friendly.",

No \"Hi, welcome, we'll be right with you\". Nothing. When I told the woman there that they had customers, all I got was a \"I know\".

An African American worker in a grey shirt (Male) with braided hair was incredibly racist to her and her friends, using an Asian accent when talking to them. He was originally on the side and took over the register from one of his coworkers on purpose with the intent of being completely racist to them. He spoke with an Asian accent ridiculing their race and telling them he can serve them for an extra $5.00. While this was happening, all of the other employees laughed and egged him on. My girlfriend and her friends felt very unsafe, especially late at night. We will try filing a police report today with the local precinct and hope this employee faces consequences.",

The surprising thing was there was homeless folks inside the store walking and smoking next to us when we were preparing to eat. The homeless guy was even asking for food to someone next to us. It felt very much like a 3rd world country's experience. The tables were dirty as well - maybe they need to hire more people for cleaning in between customers. The French fries were cold as well, as if they were probably heated long time ago. Also, the store associates should provide a tray for customers who are going to be sitting/eating inside the store instead of paper packets for takeouts.",

Service was fast, quick and extremely efficient. Waiting time was less than 5 minutes. Good fast food spot for a quick bite to eat! They also offer order yourself service and of course on the app too! Food was good. The only reason I couldn't give this McDonald's a 5 stars was because many tables and chairs to eat in were a bit dirty. Also, the restrooms were dirty it could have been better other than that #eatoutside and don't forget if you like my review please give it a thumbs up!",

As mentioned in other reviews here, there is a problem with the overall cleanliness of the restaurant and the \"transients\" that call the place \"home\".\n\nI'm not sure if there is a homeless shelter nearby or if people just love to hang out in the place, but there are always less fortunate people there especially in the morning. Just this morning I've witnessed the NYPD escort a woman out of the restaurant that was loitering. There are signs throughout the restaurant that clearly state No Loitering and that there is a 30 min time limit. Now that the weather is getting colder, people are just looking to stay warm.\n\nUnfortunately, McDonalds is in a difficult position. As a former General Manager of a fast food restaurant, I used to deal with \"rough\" teenagers and \"undesirables\" especially at night. I wanted my paying customers to have a friendly, warm and inviting environment to eat in with their families. The \"rough\" crowd made that very difficult to maintain. I, like McDs started with signs. The McDs in this review also has full time security to help keep the people safe and moving.\n\nYou see, you just can't stand at the door and not allow people to come into McDs. The best you can do is try to manage it. I give them a lot of credit for trying to do just that. I also give credit to the employees as they have to deal with it all day long. As far as the cleanliness, they can do a much better job there. I can't speak for all the people given Lobby Duty, but I've never seen one with a cleaning bottle and rag to clean the tables. So, even I had to sit at a table this morning that wasn't clean. It wasn't exactly disgusting, but it wasn't clean either.\n\nI've never been in the bathrooms because I try to avoid them at all costs. I've seen the people that come out of there and also the bathrooms at Penn Station down the block. It can't be pleasant in there and frankly, I wouldn't want to clean it either.\n\nThere are other McDs in the area, but this one is at times convenient for me. You can't beat the price for breakfast in that area in NYC. I would NEVER bring my family there. But for a quick stop in the morning, it's ok.\n\nSo, the 3 stars are just for the environment, the \"ambiance\" and the cleanliness. The food and the staff are great, it's just a \"difficult\" place to eat in given the community.",

One time, I went in to order something around 1 am, but was unable to find any seating because other people were on their laptop hogging the booths and not ordering anything. They were taking up space. Mcdonalds staff did nothing about it when we complained about there being no seating. Most Mcdonalds offers free refills on medium and large drinks, but not this one. One time I asked the manager for a free refill and he was very rude and dismissive. This is not an ideal place to dine in at all, but it is still convenient to order a coffee there though.",

Stood at the register for about 10 to 12 mins waiting for one of the many employees walking pass me to deliver the orders outside. Once they finally notice me, they took my order. After I waited around another 15 more mins to get my order. I was gonna ask for BBQ sauce but decided I didn't wanna wait an extra 5 mins for that. Overall, this restaurant only prioritize the drive-thru and not the dine-in area. Dine-in area has no cashier available because everyone is focus on drive-thru. So many workers on the front but none on cashier. If your coming here for lunch hour order online or else your lunch hour might turn into only 20 min lunch with all the waiting you'll be doing here.",

Numerous times we get home after a visit to McDonald's and notice the forgot to include apple slices, or apple juice.  I agree these are smaller items and do not effect the price much, however, when you have kids waiting for their orders get very upset and get angry n hurt that these things are missing.  It is very upsetting!  Also, we tend to order a lot of unsweetened ice teas.  8 out of 10 times the tea tastes disgusting!!  It is old tea or the bag doesn't get changed when the make more.  I get so mad that no one seems to care enough to be sure every shift cares to do their job correctly to ensure a high quality in ALL their products.

        "review_processed": "This McDonald's gets a 3 rating due to their lack of attention to drive thru orders.  Numerous times we get home after a visit to McDonald's and notice the forgot to include apple slices, or apple juice.  I agree these are smaller items and do not effect the price much, however, when you have kids waiting for their orders get very upset and get angry n hurt that these things are missing.  It is very upsetting!  Also, we tend to order a lot of unsweetened ice teas.  8 out of 10 times the tea tastes disgusting!!  It is old tea or the bag doesn't get changed when the make more.

We all have choices.\n\nThere is some good leadership at this store and bad. There is no in between. Take your chances. I mainly go there for the tea....when it's good."

It is next to a club and i am sure a burger sounds better after drinking, but anyway back to the inconsistency. I show up everyday at 2:45 am and sometimes i can get a qtr pounder and other days they say it's not on the late night menu. What really bugs me is that several time I am told breakfast only! No ody shows up at that time for a mcgriddle. Stop being lazy and make the food. Most of the breakfast is ready to slap together and is why they do it, but i show up before 3 am and I want a burger! Why can't the staff get their stuff together as i wrote this review 3 people drove off because they did not want breakfast either.",

Demanding customer service number to complain. Fine, that's his right. But as the lady at the register tried to help him, he kept yelling at her. They said that he was an officer in the Army. To me, that is disgraceful and highly insulting that anyone would use rank and the military to treat people like that. I don't believe he is any sort of military let alone an officer.  And I did tell him that \"if he is a retired military officer, he is a disgrace of a former officer.\" To which he wanted to go out and fight me. Furthering my belief he is no officer. I was an E-4 Specialist and know that he or any other member of any military force is trained to use rank or status as an excuse to belittle anyone. And if you do you disgrace the uniform the military and your country by treating anyone with disrespect.  I'll stand up to anyone who tries's that type of behavior.  The staff at McDonald's was doing a fantastic job, my food is delicious.  Thank you!",

There is one manager here that frequently yells at his employees for no reason at all, IN FRONT OF THE CUSTOMERS! I honestly feel bad that they have to be treated like that because apparently the manager doesn't understand that places get busy and there will be a wait a bit longer than usual. This location always has homeless people standing/sitting at each exit of the parking lot. One hot, summer day, I was leaving this McDonald's and made the mistake of putting down my windows down before leaving the parking lot. I was stopped by one homeless man and he asked for money, and usually I don't carry cash, but I happened to have a couple quarters in my car, so I gave them to him and he thanked me for helping him and his brother out. I pulled forward a bit more, and his brother stood up, walked over to my car, and I thought he was just going to thank me for the money, but nope! He literally started climbing inside my car to get some food from the passenger seat. He was grabbing me, and had his hands on my steering wheel and I started driving away to get him to stop after offering him some more quarters so he could buy his own food, and he kept yelling at me saying that he wanted the food I had. In the end, I left being robbed of the few bucks I had in coins in my car, and feeling very much violated. Again, this could have been avoided by having my windows up, but I thought it would be worth including that experience in my review. Really not a bad place, but definitely not the best.",

If you are wondering HOW things could go sideways, you wouldn't have to expand your view further then the amount of druggys that go to this McDonalds. Half of them don't even buy anything, they just stand around (to heat up I presume) waiting for the security to kick them out. The other half stand in line and figure out that they can't buy anything at the front desk then leave. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this if they kept to themselves like everyone else ordering something at the McDonald's, but they would  randomly yell, ask questions, pan handle, and just were being a general nuisance. I understand that an establishment can't control who their costumers are, so it's not exactly the MD's fault, but still this Micky D's should be avoided at all costs for that reason. I give them 2 stars instead of one because the good customer service and magically clean bathroom. Seriously these cashiers have to deal with a lot of weird stuff and they somehow aren't mentally broken by the end of the day. I went at 11 at night which probably affects my review, but from the first impression I'm not inclined to go again to find out how it is in the day unless it was simultaneously the only restaurant, I was starving more than a communist in the gulag, and I lost my ability to cook food myself. Seriously don't go here it's horrible.",

I parked at McDonald's and walked the 65 seconds or so to the liquor store. A purchase and the return voyage took all of five minutes. By the time I had returned, there was a boot on my car. The person responsible for this was in the parking lot and informed me that to be considered a McDonald's customer, I would have had to make my fast-food purchase first, and then been given  30 minutes in the parking lot. It's a cold November evening. Fast food sitting in a car would be cold by the time I had returned, so I did things in what seemed like the logical order. $90 later, I was too disgusted to eat. I went into the store to file a complaint, but was bullied out by the towing staff. This isn't a predatory company per se, but they're in bed with one.",

There is also an employee always in the parking lot or the store wearing a black shirt that says \"security\" in big white letters. What this person's actual background is in security is less certain--probably the entire training consists of putting on the shirt. The store is not as clean as one is used to with McDonald's franchises, and the drive-through service tends to be slower. I assume this is because they have a hard time keeping good help.

Everything processed for the order... once I succeeded in completing the order with small amount of difficulty. Checked my account two days later as part of semi-weekly review. The McD's mobile ordering double charged me for the order. They processed two charges for the one order. When rhe corporate McD's was contacted they apologized, stated the program has occasional quirks (being worked out), and told me I needed to drive out of my way to go back to the store to get my money back. After explaining that they would have to reimburse my time and expenses to do their legwork in correcting their error of stealing my money AND explaining that they simply review their detail processing report of electronic charges for the two transactions (I provided the actual transaction info for date, time, #'s etc) they agreed to process the charge reversal.... because they WOULD NOT reimburse my time/expenses to return to get my refund of money they stole out of my account. After considerable time and insistence on my part, the manager agreed and reviewed the transactions report, verified the double billing, and assured the charge will be reversed. I got a follow up call from the area manager for McD's who turned out to be VERY unprofessional and rude in her attitude and handling if the matter. She actually admitted she hung up on me when I was reprimanding her on her shortcomings for not listening to what I was saying and continually speaking loudly over me, while I was speaking. Interesting..... is this how McD's is improving the bottom line, by stealing? NO ONE at McD's, even after explaining the process to correct an improper charge, had a clue how to address or willingness to pursue. They directly stated it was on me. I had to come back to a store, out of my way, to get a refund of my money, that they improperly seized from my account. Unbelievable as that is for my 1st mobile order/purchase experience w/McD's they were excited I used it and recommended I try the mobile order system again soon. Yeah right..... I'm gonna use a system with a 100% failure rate (my experience) and that they have no knowledge of how to process system failures, that do occur to their admission & knowledge. Horrible experience in all regards. Clearly rolled out the program with known links and poor or no training in corrective measures when incurred.",

After explaining that they would have to reimburse my time and expenses to do their legwork in correcting their error of stealing my money AND explaining that they simply review their detail processing report of electronic charges for the two transactions (I provided the actual transaction info for date, time, #'s etc) they agreed to process the charge reversal.... because they WOULD NOT reimburse my time/expenses to return to get my refund of money they stole out of my account. After considerable time and insistence on my part, the manager agreed and reviewed the transactions report, verified the double billing, and assured the charge will be reversed. I got a follow up call from the area manager for McD's who turned out to be VERY unprofessional and rude in her attitude and handling if the matter. She actually admitted she hung up on me when I was reprimanding her on her shortcomings for not listening to what I was saying and continually speaking loudly over me, while I was speaking. Interesting..... is this how McD's is improving the bottom line, by stealing? NO ONE at McD's, even after explaining the process to correct an improper charge, had a clue how to address or willingness to pursue. They directly stated it was on me. I had to come back to a store, out of my way, to get a refund of my money, that they improperly seized from my account. Unbelievable as that is for my 1st mobile order/purchase experience w/McD's they were excited I used it and recommended I try the mobile order system again soon. Yeah right..... I'm gonna use a system with a 100% failure rate (my experience) and that they have no knowledge of how to process system failures, that do occur to their admission & knowledge. Horrible experience in all regards. Clearly rolled out the program with known links and poor or no training in corrective measures when incurred."

Another major situation I noticed is the McDonald's need some updating.

When I got there, she looked like I was a beggar, because I was working and decided to go eat. However, the employee said as \"yes, what will you want!\" No! No! No! But in a disgusting way. But I ignored him and left the place. In addition, the restaurant has a second floor for those who are not in a hurry to go for lunch, breakfast or whatever. There is something very good about this place is that there are staff who speak Spanish and English. This place is also extremely close to the Honduran Embassy. I recommend this place.",
